# Appearance {#appearance}

Jayarsha is a tall, spare old man of seventy-five, 6'1", brown-skinned and clear-faced, with black hair gone white at the temples and dark brown eyes that have lost none of their attention. He dresses in a long linen robe and carries in his left hand a gold-washer's shallow pan of polished wood, the sign of a head of one of the panning-families, which he uses as other old men use a staff.

# Dossier {#dossier}

## The Padmadiksha

The [Padmadiksha]{.name data-type="affiliation/lineage"} are one of the twenty-eight hereditary panning-families of [[affiliation-suvrgrjnpd|the Janpoda of the Gold Mountain]], who work the gold-bearing wash below [[place-goldmountain|the Gold Mountain]] and whose heads meet quarterly as **the Twenty-Eight**, settle disputes among themselves and speak with one voice on the panning regime. The family is among the oldest of them. Jayarsha has headed it for forty years and has sat at the quarterly table through every argument about the wash that anyone now living remembers.

He is a **Danhija**, of the productive tarona, and he has sat in the sabhra in his village's turn three times. He is not now a member of it. His daughter is.

## The Daughter

Jayarsha believed that a daughter of a great house should be taught what its sons are taught, and he had [[being-prtrkpdmdksh|Pritarika Padmadiksha]] taught law, rhetoric, natural philosophy and the martial studies. The older houses of the janpoda objected, and he was powerful enough to ignore them. When Pritarika came of age those studies made her indispensable in the politics of the sabhra, and she is now a seated member of it, a widow and the steward of her late husband's house as well as her own.

## The Table

When Jayarsha dies the Padmadiksha's seat among the Twenty-Eight passes to the head the family names. No woman has sat at that table. His brother's son [Rajabar]{.name data-type="being/npc"} expects the seat, and several of the other twenty-seven expect him to have it. Jayarsha means to name Pritarika, and to do it while he is alive to defend it.

## Psyche

### Personality

Jayarsha is courteous, stubborn, precise in argument and very patient. He has outlived most of the men who opposed him and does not hurry. He keeps the household shrine himself every morning and has done since his wife died.

### Motivation

He wants Pritarika seated in his place among the Twenty-Eight before he dies, so that the family's voice on the panning regime does not pass to his nephew.

### Strengths

Forty Years at the Table
: He knows every precedent the Twenty-Eight have set and most of the arguments they lost.

A Washer's Eye
: He can read a season's wash from a single pan and the family's books from a single page.

### Weaknesses

Age
: He is seventy-five, and the question he means to settle may outlast him.

The Nephew's Friends
: Rajabar has allies among the panning-families who resent the Padmadiksha's standing and resented his daughter's education first.

## Social

### Patrons and Allies

[[being-prtrkpdmdksh|Pritarika Padmadiksha]]
: His daughter, whom he educated against the custom of the great houses.

### Rivals

[Rajabar Padmadiksha]{.name data-type="being/npc"}
: His brother's son, who expects to head the family.

The great houses of the janpoda
: Who opposed Pritarika's education and oppose her succession for the same reasons.

### Affiliations

[[affiliation-suvrgrjnpd|Suvargeri]]
: Danhija, head of the Padmadiksha and one of the Twenty-Eight.

[[affiliation-vrnkpnthn|Varnuka Pantheon]]
: Upasoka, keeping the household shrine and [[affiliation-mahajaya|Mahajaya]]'s feasts.

## Plot Hooks

The Quarterly Table
: The Twenty-Eight meet in a month. Jayarsha wants to know which of the other twenty-seven heads will stand with Rajabar, and hires the party to find out without his asking any of them.

The Wash-Book
: A page of the Padmadiksha's wash-book from fifty years ago is missing, and Rajabar's friends say it recorded a share the family took that was not its own. Jayarsha needs the page, or a copy that will satisfy the table.

A Message for His Daughter
: Jayarsha has a letter for Pritarika that he will not send by any of the family's own servants. He wants it carried by strangers.
