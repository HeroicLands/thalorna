# Appearance {#appearance}

Devanur was a man of middle height, 5'10", with medium-brown skin weathered by thirty years of the march road, black hair he kept long and dark brown eyes. He dressed plainly, in a riding coat of good cloth, and over it wore the old gold collar of the crown on every day he sat in court. He died at sixty, at [[place-sandyapur|Sandyapur]], of a fever in the worst month of the year.

# Dossier {#dossier}

## The Crown of the March

Devanur was Maharava of [[affiliation-bhumipal|Bhumipal]] for twenty-eight years, from the age of thirty-two until his death four years ago. He ruled from Sandyapur, where the road ends and the water is reliable, and the crown he held was the crown of one road. Its writ ran on the march road, at the wells and along the coast. The herding country between belonged to the Samontas, and the companies on the road were paid out of the escort money, when it came in.

It came in late every year he reigned. A Maharava of the march who cannot pay the companies is not deposed, and Devanur was never deposed. He made promises instead: to the captains, to the Samontas, to the sheikhs on the road. He kept enough of them that the road stayed open through three lean seasons, and he left the rest to his son.

## The Collar

In the last years of his reign Devanur ordered from [[being-prtmjkydr|Pritimaja Kayadara]] at [[place-chendrapur2|the Moon City]] a collar for his heir to be confirmed in. It was to be of gold bought on the road from the west and lapis from [[place-slvrgorges|the Silver Gorges]], heavier and finer than the old collar, and made by the most celebrated jeweller in the region. Devanur paid for the materials and half the fee out of a treasury that owed the companies a season's wages.

He meant the Martial Council to see a rich crown at the confirmation and not to count it. He died before the collar was finished, and his son was confirmed in the old one. Pritimaja has since abandoned the piece because it would not come out as he had promised.

## The Estate

The present Maharava inherited his father's arrears with his father's crown. The **Koshadyoksha**, administering the late king's estate, is pursuing Pritimaja in Chendrapur for the gold, the lapis and the half-fee, and calls their keeping theft. Every coin of it is owed already, to the captains on the road.

## Psyche

### Personality

Devanur was patient, gracious, vain of his court's appearance and generous with promises he could not keep. He was liked by almost everyone who met him once and trusted by almost nobody who dealt with him twice.

### Motivation

He wanted his heir confirmed in a collar worth more than the arrears the crown owed the companies, so that the Martial Council would see a rich crown and not count it.

### Strengths

The Road Kept Open
: Through three lean seasons the march road never closed in his reign, which the Martial Council counted in his favor.

The Court's Face
: He could make a poor court look like a rich one for as long as a visitor stayed.

### Weaknesses

Promises
: He paid with his word where he had no coin, and he died owing both.

The Collar
: He spent on appearance what his captains were owed in wages, and his son is still paying for it.

## Social

### Patrons and Allies

The Martial Council of Bhumipal
: The Samontas who confirmed his succession, and confirmed his son's in the old collar.

### Rivals

The company captains of the march road
: Owed their arrears through his whole reign. [[being-umrtdrtn|Umarti Daritan]] is one of them.

[[being-prtmjkydr|Pritimaja Kayadara]]
: Who holds the gold and the fee and has delivered nothing.

### Affiliations

[[affiliation-bhumipal|Bhumipal]]
: Maharava, from his accession until his death.

[[affiliation-vrnkpnthn|Varnuka Pantheon]]
: Upasoka, confirmed by the rites the ushtakas performed at his accession.

## Plot Hooks

The Gold in the Workshop
: The Koshadyoksha hires the party to go to Chendrapur and bring back the gold and the lapis from Pritimaja's workshop, by the court's judgment if possible and without it if not.

The Captains' Claim
: A company captain on the march road says the collar's gold was promised to her company's pay in the late Maharava's own words, before witnesses. She wants the party to find one of the witnesses.

The Drawing
: Devanur's drawing for the collar is in the palace at Sandyapur. Pritimaja says he could finish the piece if he saw it again, and the present Maharava might pay for a finished collar what he will not pay for an unfinished one.
