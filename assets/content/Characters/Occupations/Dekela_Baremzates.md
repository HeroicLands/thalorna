# Appearance {#appearance}

Dékêla Bàremzâtês is a 32-year-old woman who stands 5'11" tall and is of moderate build. She has an angular face with prominent cheekbones, a broad forehead, and an angular jaw that leads to a strong chin. Her piercing brown eyes sit beneath heavy brows and give her a penetrating gaze. She has a hawkish nose and wide lips. She has olive skin with a ruddy complexion. Her auburn hair is swept up and held with carved combs.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Dékêla Bàremzâtês is a potter of Aelissium, the trade city of [[place-vylariargn|Vylaría]], a Vylarian freewoman who was raised at her parents' wheel and now keeps their shop.

Dékêla learned to throw at the wheel of a shop off the market where her parents made plain crockery for the households of Aelissium. By the time the shop came to her she had gone somewhere her parents never went: patterned ware, bowls and jars and lamps with designs worked into the slip, and glazes she has spent years arriving at—a green that holds its color through the kiln, a blue that came out of a season of failures. She is never satisfied with any of it. What she cannot do is sell. She takes a stall at the markets and fairs and stands behind it saying too little, and the merchants who might carry her ware to the capital have never been asked.

She is a known figure among the potters of Vylaria, and less known than her work deserves.

## Psyche

### Personality

Dékêla is intent, self-critical and awkward with strangers, and will break a bowl she has spent a day on for a flaw a buyer would never see.

### Motivation

Dékêla wants the next glaze—the color she has seen in her head and not yet got out of the kiln—and she wants her ware in the hands of people who will use it.

### Strengths

Skilled at the wheel, inventive with glaze and pattern, attentive to detail.

## Social

Dékêla holds her master's seal from the potters' collegium of Aelissium, which her parents held before her and is the potter the others come to about glaze and never about business.

## Companions

### Patrons

Dékêla's patrons are the households of Aelissium that have found her stall and come back to it, and two or three merchants of the city who buy her patterned ware by the crate at a price she should never have agreed to.

### Enemies

Nobody who wishes her harm, but a rival shop in the potters' street has begun copying her patterns in a cheaper glaze and selling them under a name close enough to hers to confuse a buyer.

## Plot Hooks

1. **Plain Ware by the Thousand**—A merchant house of Aelissium has offered Dékêla a contract for plain crockery in quantity, enough to keep the shop for years and to leave her no time for anything else.

2. **The Glaze That Failed**—A commission for a senatorial household—her first—has come out of the kiln with the blue gone gray across half the set. The delivery is in a week.

3. **The Copy**—The rival shop's copies of her patterns have reached the capital under a name that is nearly hers. The collegium will hear a case only if she brings one, in front of people.

4. **The Examination**—The collegium has asked Dékêla to sit as an examiner for new masters, an honor that would give her a voice on standards. It would require her to speak to strangers about money and method, several times a year.
