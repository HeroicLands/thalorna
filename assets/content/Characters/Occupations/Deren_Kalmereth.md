Her brown hair is loose and wavy, and her hands are cracked from brine.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Deren Kálmereth is a salter of [[place-sourimael|Sóurimel]], the [[lore-elavendriclt|Élavendri]] village that keeps the birch law inside [[place-silvrfrsts|the Silver Forests]], a freewoman who works her father's salting house beside the stream.

Sóurimel has no salt of its own. Deren's family buys the coarse gray salt that comes up from the coast on the carts that go back down loaded with charcoal and honey, and it salts what the village cannot eat fresh: the venison its hunters are allowed, the fish of the stream and the pork of the autumn killing. She grades and packs it and sells it at the market in the village and on the Sórvanda farms beyond the wood. She has an eye for a good barrel and a long memory for a bad one, and she takes the family's name in the trade seriously.

The salting house stands on the cart road at the edge of the village, and every stranger who comes to Sóurimel passes its door. That makes Deren one of the people the [[affiliation-alndnwrdns|Wardens]] have asked, courteously and twice, who passed through in the autumn.

## Psyche

### Personality

Deren is careful, exacting and uneasy with praise. She doubts herself more than her work deserves.

### Motivation

She wants the family trade kept sound and her father's name kept good. She wants nothing to do with the Wardens' question, and knows she cannot have that.

### Strengths

She grades salt and meat better than anyone in the village, she keeps an honest tally, and she remembers faces.

### Weaknesses

Her perfectionism costs her sales, and her wish to stay out of trouble makes her slow to say what she knows.

## Social

### Companions

Her father, whose hands are failing, and the carters who bring the salt up.

### Patrons

The households of Sóurimel and the farms of [[place-sorvanda|Sórvanda]], who buy her barrels for the winter.

### Enemies

None of her own. A carter she would not cover for has stopped stopping at her door.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-kngdmlvndr|Kingdom of Élavendre]]**: Deren is a Freeman of the crown.

## Plot Hooks

The Cart in the Autumn
: A carter came up the road in the autumn with a stranger on the bench who bought salt and paid in Péravel silver. Deren has not told the Wardens, because the carter is her father's friend, and the bark from [[place-wkngstnd|the Waking Stand]] lies in a collection at [[place-beravel|Péravel]].

The Bad Barrel
: A barrel of her salt pork has made a household sick, and the barrel was not packed in her salting house. Someone is selling under the Kálmereth mark, and she asks a party to find the seller.

The Answer
: The priestess [[being-melvesaelarv|Mélvesa Elarven]] has told the village to answer the Wardens plainly. Deren asks a party to go with her to the Wardens and stand beside her while she does.
