His chestnut hair is tied in a low tail, and clay is dry in the creases of his knuckles.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Hethar Othral is a potter of [[place-valdun|Valdun]], an [[lore-elavendriclt|Élavendri]] freeman who throws and fires stoneware in a yard inside the town wall.

He makes what a border town breaks: crocks and jars for the stock fairs' butter and cheese, pitchers for the inns, lamp-bowls for the garrison and the heavy salt-glazed jars the pack-trains carry east. He learned from his father and has taught two apprentices of his own, and he holds that a pot should outlast whoever bought it. The drovers' wives and the innkeepers buy from him because his ware survives a cart.

Valdun's wall encloses the market and the stock pens as well as the houses, and Hethar's kiln stands against it. The kiln is what has drawn trouble to his yard this winter: the sworn company of [[affiliation-brdrmltia|the Border Militia]] wants the ground for a store, and the hill levy says that ground has always been the potters'.

## Psyche

### Personality

Hethar is patient, steady and set in his ways. He distrusts new glazes and new men alike until they have proved themselves in the fire.

### Motivation

He wants the yard and the kiln kept in his family, his apprentices trained properly and his ware known for lasting.

### Strengths

He is a skilled and experienced potter, a good teacher and a fair dealer.

### Weaknesses

He resists change, and he will lose a customer rather than make a pot the way the customer wants it.

## Social

### Companions

His two apprentices and the innkeepers who drink his ale out of his own pitchers.

### Patrons

The households, inns and garrison of Valdun, and the pack-masters who buy jars for the eastern road.

### Enemies

The militia's quartermaster, who wants his yard.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-kngdmlvndr|Kingdom of Élavendre]]**: Hethar is a Freeman of the crown.

## Plot Hooks

The Kiln Yard
: [[being-elenorthaurn|Captain Élenor Thaurnde]]'s quartermaster has marked Hethar's yard for a store, and [[being-jeldormorlin|Jeldor Mórlineth]] has told Hethar to refuse. The potter asks a party to find a paper that says whose the ground is before the two captains settle it over his kiln.

The Sealed Jar
: A pack-master bought a dozen of Hethar's heavy jars sealed and paid twice the price for wax seals of his own. One came back broken from the east road, and what spilled from it was not oil.

The Imperial Shard
: The hill hunter who brought in the unrusted helmet also brought a shard of glazed ware that Hethar cannot match and the [[affiliation-ordoarcanis|Order]]'s antiquarians want badly. The hunter left it with Hethar to price.
