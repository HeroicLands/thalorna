# Dossier {#dossier}

Kadumuya Kubasuni is a perfumer of [[place-shamular|Shamular]], the merchant town of [[place-milazun|Milazun]], born to a [[lore-taruzelianclt|Taruzelian]] family of old standing whose money is mostly gone and whose shop on the market square is what remains of it. The shop is narrow, with stills and oils in the back room, and it holds the oldest perfumer's license on the square. The perfumers' seat on the [[affiliation-gldbrdshmlr|Guild Board of Shamular]] goes with that license.

She has the finest nose in Shamular and spends her days blending attar of rose from the island valleys, resins off the [[lore-khelathiclt|Khelathi]] ships and ambergris when the corsairs have some, in combinations nobody has tried. The guild families of Shamular come to her for scents made for a single wearer, blended over weeks and never sold to anyone else, and hers is the shop whose smell fills the square. She keeps no books worth the name: her suppliers are paid when she remembers, her guild dues are late, and the shop lives on the reputation of its scents.

## Background

**The back room.** Kadumuya grew up among the stills and was blending before she could reach the bench. The shop came to her young, with its license and its debts.

**The pupils.** She teaches anyone with a nose who asks, for nothing, and some of the apprentices of the square learned more from her than from their masters.

## Psyche

### Personality

Kadumuya is absorbed, generous and hard on her own work. She will call a scent she has spent a month on a failure over one note.

### Motivation

She wants to make scents nobody has made before and to teach what she knows. She treats keeping the shop solvent as a means to that, and remembers it late.

### Strengths

She is highly creative, a master of blending and a patient teacher.

### Weaknesses

She cannot keep accounts, and she does not see a debt as a danger until it is called.

## Social

### Enemies

A rival perfumer's house on the same square, better run and less gifted, would like her formulas, her lease and her clients, in that order.

### Others

- **The guild families of Shamular**, who commission her scents and pay well for a scent nobody else wears.
- **The locksmith [[being-tndnhlrn|Tanadan Helaruni]]**, a street behind the square.
- **The apprentices of the square** she has taught.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-cnfdrtntrzlnstts|Confederation of Taruzelian States]]**: a Freeman on the register of [[affiliation-yamuzel|Yamuzel]], the city-state that holds Milazun, free to trade under the Confederation's tariffs and entitled to petition the Grand Council through her state's councilors.
- **[[affiliation-lizelas|Faith of Lizelas]]**: one of the lay faithful, the Devran, who keep the Nurturer's feasts without office in the temple.
- **[[affiliation-gldbrdshmlr|Guild Board of Shamular]]**: a Member of the Board, holding the perfumers' unelected seat with the oldest perfumer's license on the square. She attends when she remembers.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The debts of a shop.** Someone has bought up Kadumuya's late debts, her suppliers' notes and her unpaid guild dues, and has not yet presented them. She heard of it from a supplier who was paid in full by a stranger, and she wants a party to learn who now holds her shop's debts before they are called.
2. **One wearer only.** A guild family has commissioned a scent and has her oath that no one else will ever wear it. A second family smelled it at a wedding and has offered three times the price for the same scent.
3. **A pupil's bottle.** A scent from Kadumuya's back room is being sold under another name across the square. One of the apprentices she taught for nothing wrote the formula down.
4. **The ambergris.** A corsair has brought Kadumuya a lump of ambergris early in the morning, as such things change hands on the square, and wants a favor for it in place of silver.
