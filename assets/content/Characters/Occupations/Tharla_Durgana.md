# Appearance {#appearance}

Tharla Durgana is a 26-year-old woman who stands 5'8" tall and is slender. Her olive skin is scarred at the wrists and across one cheek, her hair, gray before its time, is braided and coiled at the nape, and her amber eyes are large and kept down in company. She wears a household's plain gray gown with the sleeves pushed back for work, and she moves through a room without being noticed.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Tharla Durgana is a domestic servant of [[place-herthema|Herthema]], a [[lore-tarvenanclt|Tarvenan]] born free in a village of the hills, who is held unfree in the house of a merchant family of the town.

Tharla was captured during a raid on her village and sold into slavery in Herthema, where she works as a housemaid for a wealthy family. Although her tasks are not as grueling as a field laborer's, being treated as property wears on her. Her sharp mind and quick reflexes have helped her avoid punishment, but she longs for freedom.
