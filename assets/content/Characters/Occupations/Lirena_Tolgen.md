# Appearance {#appearance}

Lirena Tolgen is a 29-year-old woman who stands 5'8" tall and is of light build. She has medium-toned skin bronzed by summers on the northern sea-roads, dark blonde hair in ringlets she shakes loose when she recites, and almond-shaped hazel eyes that fill easily. A small star is tattooed on her left shoulder, the mark of the hall where she was given her first saga.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Lirena Tolgen is a Provénzian skald of [[place-jalnazdal|Jalnasdal]], trained in the halls of the [[place-nrdlndsrgn|Nordlands]] by [[affiliation-skaldscrcl|the Skalds' Circle]], who recites in the harbor taverns where the northern crews drink and at the tables of the capital's houses that have a taste for the north.

She went north at fourteen as a ship's boy's sister, stayed when a skald of a chieftain's hall heard her sing, and came home at twenty-five with the Circle's training and a habit the Circle disapproves of: she sets the old northern myths against the events of the day, so that a Peer's quarrel at Jalnasdal becomes a feud of gods in a hall of ice. The capital loves it. The northern crews in the harbor think it close to blasphemy and come to hear it anyway. Her recitations are passionate and full of gesture, and she cannot get through a tale of loss with a steady voice.

The court's spending has doubled the rents of the harbor quarter, and the taverns where she recites for the crews are closing one by one or turning into lodgings for the court's clerks. Her best patron now is a house of the Atavel party that wants a saga of the Council's quarrel in which the Earl of Degavel is the frost-giant.

## Psyche

### Personality

Lirena is warm, passionate and quick to tears and to temper, and she is sometimes too much for a quiet room.

### Motivation

She wants her sagas remembered, and she wants to keep singing for the crews in the harbor who taught her what an audience is.

### Strengths

She is a charismatic reciter with a fine memory and a poet's ear, and she can make a room of strangers weep.

### Weaknesses

She cannot keep her feelings out of a recitation, or her opinions out of a saga.

## Social

### Companions

The northern crews of the harbor taverns, and [[being-bldnstylgn|Balden Estilgon]] of Aurelane, the only other Provénzian skald of the Circle, who disapproves of her and writes to her every month.

### Patrons

The houses of the capital with a taste for the north, and lately a house of the Atavel party.

### Enemies

The more conservative skalds of the Circle, who say she bends the sagas, and the Earl of Degavel's household, which has heard of the frost-giant.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-skaldscrcl|The Skalds' Circle]]**: Lirena recites under the Circle's training and recognition.
- **[[affiliation-kngdmprvnz|Kingdom of Provénzia]]**: She is a Freeman of the crown.
- **[[affiliation-lusinia|Faith of Lusinia]]**: She keeps the singers' festivals.

## Plot Hooks

The Frost-Giant
: The Atavel house has paid in advance for a saga of the Council's quarrel, to be recited at a feast the Earl of Degavel's friends will attend. Lirena has written it, and since writing it she has been followed.

The Last Tavern
: The harbor tavern where Lirena recites for the northern crews has been bought by a court official's agent, who means to turn it into lodgings. The crews have asked her to find out who is behind the buying, and they have offered to settle it their own way if she will not.

The Disputed Verse
: The Circle has summoned Lirena to answer for a verse in which she set a northern god in a Provénzian hall. If the gathering finds against her, she loses the Circle's recognition and every patron who pays for it.
