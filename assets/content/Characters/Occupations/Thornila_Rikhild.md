2. **Old Grudges**—One of the poor Thornila's charity was meant for has not forgotten how she looked at him, and says so where the temple can hear.

3. **Echoes of the Past**—A charitable work Thornila organized years ago is found to have done its poor more harm than good, and they remember whose it was.

5. **The Opportunity**—The Temple of Jánus offers Thornila a higher office, and the price is the charitable work that is the one part of her ministry that reaches the poor.
