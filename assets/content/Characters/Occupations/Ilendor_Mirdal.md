# Appearance {#appearance}

Ilendor Mirdal is a 57-year-old man who stands 5'4" tall and is of medium build. He has olive skin weathered by forty years of nights on rooftops, chestnut hair gone dull and tied in a low tail, and hooded dark brown eyes that look past a questioner as though at something behind him. His aquiline nose and wide mouth give him a hawk's profile, and his fingers are stained with the inks of his charts.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Ilendor Mirdal is an astrologer of [[place-jalnazdal|Jalnasdal]] and the reader of the stars to the household of [[being-rutalplnvr|Rutal Pélanvri]], Earl of [[place-degavel|Degavel]] and First Peer of the [[affiliation-councilpeers|Council of Peers]].

An eclipse he saw as a boy turned him to the stars, and he learned the reckoning of them from the priests of [[affiliation-marendas|Marendas]] and the mathematics from the academies of [[place-aureliane|Aurelane]]. He has served the Pélanvri for twenty years. His readings have chosen the days of their marriages, their journeys and their suits, and the earl's enemies say they have chosen a good deal of the earl's policy. He is respected for his accuracy and known for being cryptic and hard to reach. The [[affiliation-ordoarcanis|Thordimalon]] licenses his practice, and in Provénzia that means the crown does too.

The contest between the crown and the Council is the city's weather, and Ilendor's charts are part of it. The Peers choose the First Peer at the year's first sitting, the Count of [[place-athavel|Atavel]]'s party needs one more voice to take the office from the earl, and the earl has asked Ilendor for the day.

## Psyche

### Personality

Ilendor is aloof, precise and dismissive of skeptics, and he speaks in qualifications that his patrons hear as certainties.

### Motivation

He wants his readings to be right and to be believed, and he wants the reckoning he has spent forty years refining written down before he dies.

### Strengths

He knows the heavens, their tables and their histories better than anyone at court, and he knows the Pélanvri household's secrets better than most of the Pélanvri.

### Weaknesses

His patron's fortunes and his reputation are now the same thing, and the earl's enemies know it.

## Social

### Companions

A pupil of the academies who copies his charts, and the priests of Marendas, with whom he argues about eclipses.

### Patrons

Rutal Pélanvri, Earl of Degavel, who keeps him in his household and asks his counsel before every move in the Council.

### Enemies

A rival astrologer who serves a house of the Atavel party and has published a reading that the First Peer's office will change hands.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-kngdmprvnz|Kingdom of Provénzia]]**: Ilendor is a Freeman of the crown.
- **[[affiliation-marendas|Faith of Marendas]]**: He keeps the festivals of knowledge and lectures at the Festival of Illumination.

## Plot Hooks

The Day of the Sitting
: Ilendor has cast the day of the First Peer's choosing, and the stars are against the earl. A man of the Atavel party has offered him a fortune to tell the earl so, and the earl will hear it either way. Ilendor wants a party to find who else has seen his chart.

The Stolen Tables
: Ilendor's tables, forty years of observations, have been taken from his study, and the rival's reading appeared a week later.

The Eclipse
: Ilendor has spent every night of the month on his roof and has put off his lecture at the Festival of Illumination. The priests of Marendas want to know what he is reckoning, and they hire a party to find out.

:::secret {title="The eclipse"}
Ilendor's reckoning puts an eclipse of the sun in the month the Council sits. He has told nobody, because whoever knows first can make it mean what they like.
