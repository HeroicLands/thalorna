# Appearance {#appearance}

Jethra Lidren is a 38-year-old woman who stands 5'6" tall and is of light build. She has a diamond face with soft cheekbones, a wide forehead and a sharp jaw that leads to a pointed chin. Her round green eyes sit beneath arched brows and give her a candid gaze. She has a delicate nose, narrow lips and medium-toned skin with a smooth complexion. Her dark blonde hair is swept up and held with carved combs, and she squints at anything nearer than the horizon.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Jethra Lidren is a sky-reader of [[place-kelpasi|Kélpasi]], the hidden village in a fold of the [[place-auldalon|Áuldalon]] hills, an [[lore-elavendriclt|Élavendri]] freewoman who reads the stars and the weather for the village's flocks, fields and journeys.

She learned the stars from her grandmother on the high pasture, and later from a chart-maker of Valdun who taught her the Aureldian reckoning of the year and the feasts the lowland priests keep. In Kélpasi she is asked when to lamb, when to cut, when the snow will close the track and when it is safe to take the cloth down to the fairs. She is practical and plain in her readings and popular for it. She has never been on a ship and is sick on a cart.

What she reads is worth more than usual this winter. A priest from the lowlands is due within the month, and the Speaker to the Lowlands, who meets such visitors at the last bend of the track, went down to [[place-valdun|Valdun]] with the winter cloth on a day Jethra told him was good, and has not come back.

## Psyche

### Personality

Jethra is calm, practical and dry. She dislikes grand prophecy and will not give a reading she cannot explain.

### Motivation

She wants the village's year to go right and her readings to be trusted. She is afraid she sent the Speaker down on the wrong day.

### Strengths

She reads weather and season accurately, she knows the Aureldian feasts by heart, and the village believes her.

### Weaknesses

She cannot travel far, and she takes the village's bad luck as her own fault.

## Social

### Companions

The shepherds of the high pasture and the Keeper of the Spring, [[being-saunarindarl|Sáunarine Darel]], who asks her when the spring will first run clear.

### Patrons

The households of Kélpasi, who pay her in cloth, cheese and help with her own small flock.

### Enemies

None in the village. The lowland priests think a sky-reader in a hill village is close to heresy.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-kngdmlvndr|Kingdom of Élavendre]]**: Jethra is a Freeman of the crown.
- **[[affiliation-thrglnklps|Thárgalon of Kélpasi]]**: She is a Villager of Kélpasi.

## Plot Hooks

The Good Day
: Jethra read the Speaker's day of departure herself, and she means to go down to Valdun and learn what happened to him. She has never been past the ridge road alone, and asks a party to take her.

The Priest's Calendar
: The lowland priest is due within the month, and the thaw may come before he does. Jethra must tell the [[affiliation-thrglnklps|Thárgalon]] whether the priest will be in the village on the night of [[lore-springguest|the Spring Guest]], and she does not like what the sky says.

The Strange Star
: A star has stood over the old wood to the north for nine nights where no star should be, and an [[affiliation-ordoarcanis|Order]] fellow in Valdun has heard that the Kélpasi sky-reader keeps a record of it. He wants her notebook.
