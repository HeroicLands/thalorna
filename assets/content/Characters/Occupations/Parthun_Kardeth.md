# Dossier {#dossier}

Parthun Kardeth is a player and play-maker of [[place-valdun|Valdun]], an [[lore-elavendriclt|Élavendri]] freeman who writes the plays for a company of players that plays the drove fairs, the inn yards and the great halls of the eastern march.

He has spent most of his life on a cart stage: a player at fourteen, the company's play-maker at thirty. He is known for a voice that fills an inn yard and for parts written so close to the life that drovers shout at the villains. His plays are drawn from the march itself, its raids, its lords and its debts, and the lords of the march come to see whether they are in them. He rewrites every scene until the company begs him to stop, and he stages none of them as written.

The company's patron is [[being-nelamisolnar|Lady Nélamis Ólnarnde]], and its principal player is [[being-veldrblthl|Veldor Pelthal]]. This winter Parthun has written a satire on a lord of the march who wants the tribes' ground opened to the crown's roads, and every lord in Valdun knows which one it means.

## Psyche

### Personality

Parthun is intense, tireless and a perfectionist, and he overworks himself and everyone around him.

### Motivation

He wants to write the play that the march remembers. He wants it staged before the company's patron thinks better of it.

### Strengths

He is a talented player and writer, with a strong stage presence and an ear for how people really speak.

### Weaknesses

He cannot leave a scene alone, and he writes about powerful men with less care than they deserve.

## Social

### Companions

The company of players, Veldor Pelthal above all, with whom he quarrels daily.

### Patrons

Lady Nélamis Ólnarnde, who pays the company's winter keep and hosts its best nights in her hall.

### Enemies

Critics among the bards of Valdun, who say a play is a song too lazy to rhyme, and the lords who have recognized themselves on his stage.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-kngdmlvndr|Kingdom of Élavendre]]**: Parthun is a Freeman of the crown.

## Plot Hooks

The Satire
: Parthun's new play mocks a lord of the march who wants the tribes' ground opened, and [[being-vargenhalmes|Lord Vargen Hálmesende]] has let it be known that he will attend the first night. Parthun asks a party to stand in the yard that night.

The Stolen Pages
: The only fair copy of the satire has been stolen from the company's cart. Parthun suspects a rival company, Veldor suspects a lord, and Lady Nélamis asks a party to find the pages before anyone reads them.

The Drover's Grudge
: A drover who saw himself as the fool in last year's play has sworn to cut the play-maker's face to match the scar on the other side. Parthun laughs about it and has stopped walking home alone.
