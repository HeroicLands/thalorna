# Appearance {#appearance}

Goremdanis Sonyardis is a 34-year-old man who stands 6'1" tall and is of moderate build. He has a long face with defined cheekbones, a broad forehead, and a strong jaw that leads to a firm chin. His almond-shaped dark brown eyes sit beneath arched brows and give him a measured gaze. He has a hawkish nose and curved lips. He has medium-toned skin with a sun-tanned complexion. His dark brown hair is kept practical and short, and he carries his lyre in an oiled leather case on his back.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Goremdanis Sonyardis is a lyre player who lives in [[place-corvinus|Korvenara]], the garrison town of [[place-alyssa|Alessa]], and plays wherever he is welcome along the roads of the farm country around it. In the town he plays in the inns along the street from the camp's south gate, which keep the garrison's hours, and on the legion's pay day, the busiest market day in the town's month, he plays in the market for whatever is thrown.

His songs are drawn from the country, its fields, rivers and weather, and they are known for the pictures they call up. The farm folk love them and the soldiers ask for them, and he plays the legion's road-songs for the recruits who walk in each spring to take the oath, because they ask for those more.

## Background

**The village.** Goremdanis was raised in a farming village of the Alessan country, where his father played the lyre at every feast and taught him to play before he could work in the fields.

**The road.** He came to Korvenara because the garrison's pay day draws money and people from a day's ride around, and he has stayed because it keeps him fed.

## Psyche

### Personality

Goremdanis is gentle, dreamy and patient, at ease in a farm kitchen and stiff in a fine house.

### Motivation

He wants a place as a court musician in [[place-orzara|Orzara]], and the polish to hold it once he has it.

### Strengths

He is a skilled player and a gifted maker of songs, and he can hold a rural crowd for an evening.

### Weaknesses

He lacks the polish that a court expects of a performer, he knows nobody of standing, and he mistakes a compliment for a promise.

## Social

### Enemies

He has none. The town's innkeepers like him and the farm folk feed him.

### Others

- **The innkeepers of the south gate street**, who give him a supper and a corner for an evening's playing.
- **The farm folk of the Korvenara country**, who send for him to play at weddings and harvests.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-vylarinmpr|Vylarian Empire]]**: a Palvethos, a free resident under imperial law without the citizenship, and liable to the Empire's taxes.
- **[[affiliation-lusinia|Faith of Lusinia]]**: one of the lay faithful, the Devran, who keeps the World-Weaver's feasts without office in the temple.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The officer from the capital.** An officer is coming from Orzara to inspect the legion. Goremdanis means to play for him and be heard in the capital, and the Vallar would like the officer kept at an inn on the road for three days.
2. **The last night.** A widow's son of fifteen has come to Korvenara to take the oath, and has spent his last free evening asking Goremdanis for the [[lore-goldbandsng|Song of the Gold Band]]. The widow is on the road behind him.
3. **The feud song.** Two veterans who claim the same plot along the road each want a song made of his claim, to be sung on pay day.
4. **The patron.** A traveler of good dress who heard him on pay day has offered him a place in a house of the capital. The traveler has given no house's name, and wants Goremdanis to leave tonight.
