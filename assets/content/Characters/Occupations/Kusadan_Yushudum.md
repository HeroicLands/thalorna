# Appearance {#appearance}

Kusadan Yushudum is a 37-year-old man who stands 6'0" tall and is of moderate build. He has a heart-shaped face with angular cheekbones, a broad forehead, and a sharp jaw that leads to a strong chin. His piercing amber eyes sit beneath straight brows and give him a penetrating gaze. He has a strong nose and narrow lips. He has medium-toned skin with a sun-kissed complexion. His black hair is combed neatly to one side. His hands are scarred by the furnace from wrist to fingertip, and a tattoo of a compass is inked on his chest.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Kusadan Yushudum is a glassworker of [[place-sharimun|Sharimun]], a freeman who has worked his father's furnace-house in the street of furnace-houses below the quarries since he was a boy. The glassmakers of the street work with sand brought by sea and the ash of the beacon's pine, their furnaces glow all night, and every furnace-house works under a license from the [Glassworkers' Guild of Sharimun]{.name data-type="affiliation/guild"}. Kusadan makes the glass birds, ships and figured lamps that the guild families of the [[affiliation-cnfdrtntrzlnstts|Confederation]] buy to stand in their halls from Sharimun to [[place-besikar2|Besikar]].

He loves the making and is bad at everything else about a shop. The books are behind, the apprentices are paid late, and the price he names is usually less than the work is worth. A bad burn costs the shop a month, and the shop cannot always afford a month.

## Background

**The furnace-house.** Kusadan learned window panes and bottles from his father and went past them, into blown vessels, figured lamps and the glass sculptures that made his name. The furnace-house came to him with its license and its debts.

## Psyche

### Personality

Kusadan is absorbed, driven and impractical, and hard on any piece of his own that falls short of what he saw before he started it. He is careless of his hands and his money in exactly the same way.

### Motivation

He wants to make glass better than any he has made, and each finished piece is only the measure for the next. Under that is the need to keep his father's furnace lit.

### Strengths

He is a master of glassblowing and figured work, inventive and painstaking with a piece once it is in hand.

### Weaknesses

He keeps no accounts, names prices too low, and is behind on his guild dues.

## Social

### Enemies

A rival glassworker of the street who wants the guild houses' commissions, is better at asking for them, and keeps an account of Kusadan's late dues that he mentions where the guild's wardens can hear.

### Others

- **The guild houses** that commission his glass for their halls and their gifts. Two of them send a steward to settle his suppliers directly, so that the piece they want is finished.

### Affiliations

- **[[affiliation-cnfdrtntrzlnstts|Confederation of Taruzelian States]]**: a Freeman on the register of [[affiliation-besikar|Besikar]], the city-state that holds Sharimun, free to trade under the Confederation's tariffs and entitled to petition the Grand Council through his state's councilors.
- **[[affiliation-sacredforge|The Sacred Forge]]**: one of the lay faithful, the Devran, who keep the feasts of the god of the creative fire without office in the temple.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The burned hand.** Kusadan has taken a commission for a guild master's wedding, the largest of his life, and has put his right hand in the furnace mouth a month before it is due. The piece is half-made and only he can finish it.
2. **The rival's bid.** The house that has bought from Kusadan for ten years is being courted by the rival with a better ledger and a copy of Kusadan's best design, and has asked him to match a price he cannot make glass at.
3. **The partner.** A merchant of the port has offered to take over the shop's books and its debts for a half share, which would keep the furnace lit and put a stranger's name on his father's door.
4. **A piece for the Compact.** An officer of the [[affiliation-auricompct|Auric Compact]] has commissioned a glass ship from Kusadan as a gift for the [[affiliation-grandcouncil|Grand Council]] and has made clear that the Compact does not accept excuses.
