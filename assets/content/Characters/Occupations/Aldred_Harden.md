# Appearance {#appearance}

Aldred Harden is a 42-year-old man who stands 5'11" tall and is of moderate build. He has a heart-shaped face with angular cheekbones, a wide forehead, and a strong jaw that leads to a firm chin. His hooded blue eyes sit beneath thin brows and give him a guarded gaze. He has a straight nose and narrow lips. He has medium-toned skin with a lightly freckled complexion. His blonde hair is combed neatly to one side.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Aldred Harden is a mercantyler of Kingshollow, the old royal seat of Aldorath in [[place-aelwyth|Aelwyth]], a gentleman of a small Aldorathi house who trades in fine cloth and worked metal for the royal household and the barons' halls.

Aldred comes of a family that holds a few farms below the king's hall, long enough to be gentry and not long enough to be barons, and his father was the first Harden to see that the hall was worth more to the house than the farms. When the court comes down to Kingshollow for a coronation or the midwinter feast, it wants hangings, plate and cloth of a kind the village does not make, and it wants them at once. Aldred supplies them, buying through the harbors of the island and selling from a warehouse at Dunmere to the household and to any hall in Aldorath that wants to look as the king's does. He knows exactly what a baron will pay to be seen wearing what the king wears.

## Psyche

### Personality

Aldred is shrewd, pleasant to anyone who can pay and short with anyone who cannot. He rates a man by his custom, and a market-town chapman lower than the chapman thinks fair.

### Motivation

Aldred wants the house richer than he found it, and he wants the royal household's custom, which a Harden with only farms would never have. The second is why he will take a loss on a coronation.

### Strengths

A hard bargainer, knows the luxury trade, well connected in the halls and the harbors.

## Social

Aldred holds his seal from the Merchants' Guild of Dunmere, chartered under the Magnum Collegium, and is one of the few of its members received in the king's hall.

## Companions

### Patrons

Aldred's patrons are the royal household at Kingshollow, whose steward buys from him for every descent of the court, and the barons who follow the king's taste.

### Enemies

The crown's Purveyor, who may take his goods for the household at the crown's price and has begun to; and a Dunmere house of older standing that supplied the court before the Hardens did.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Purveyance**—The Purveyor has requisitioned Aldred's whole stock of cloth for the coronation at the crown's price, a third of what it cost him. He can refuse and lose the household, or accept and lose the year.

2. **The Raider's Bolt**—A bolt of Provenzian silk has come to Aldred cheap through a Stormveld harbor, off a ship the Nordmen took. The baron who wants it has a son who died on that ship.

3. **The Descent**—The court is coming to Kingshollow a month early, and the steward has asked for a feast's worth of plate and hangings that are still at sea.

4. **The Baron's Account**—A baron owes Aldred two years' custom and has just been named to the king's council. Pressing the debt would end the trade; forgiving it would end the house.
