# Appearance {#appearance}

Ilthann Braldaruk is a 42-year-old man, 6'1" tall and massively built, with golden skin, amber eyes and close-cropped black hair graying at the temples. A pale scar crosses his forehead. He wears scale over quilted padding and takes steep steps slowly, resting a hand on the wall.

# Dossier {#dossier}

**Age 42. Man-at-Arms.**

Ilthann Braldaruk is a sworn guard of the High Jarl's household at [[place-stormveil|Stormveil]]. He holds doors, separates drunken men without breaking them and teaches younger guards how to use a shield in a narrow passage. His knees ache on the steps to the hall. He wants work at a bench, shaping stone, while he can still choose it.

[[being-wilriththorn|Ilthira Rultharuk]] directs his guard detail under [[being-althmilhrnd|Althmil Hrindaruk]], who commands the household. She supports his request for lighter duty. [[being-dunwaldraven|Nulthann Mirvaruk]], another sworn man, calls this softness while demanding harsher treatment of the harbor captives.

## Psyche

Deliberate and restrained, Ilthann knows the damage his strength can do. He wants his dependents secure and his oath honorably discharged. He is better at stopping a fight than asking a powerful man for the terms of his own departure.

## Social

The hall provides his food and standing, and its steward decides what support accompanies lighter duties. He respects Ilthira's practical judgment and protects the dignity of [[being-alfwinstormw|Thalmil Braldaruk]], whose failing strength is plain on guard duty. The younger men ask his advice when bravado has stopped helping.

## Plot Hooks

A place away from the door
: Ilthira offers Ilthann training work, but he wants the hall's support for his household stated before giving up his guard place. He asks for a witness who can hear the agreement without speaking for either side.

The moot threshold
: With the common moot approaching, two groups of sworn men demand the same approach to the hall. Ilthann asks for help marking separate waiting places and carrying the terms to the Truce-Warden before an argument becomes a drawn weapon.
