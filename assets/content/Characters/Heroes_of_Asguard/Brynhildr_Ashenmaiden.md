# Appearance {#appearance}

Brynhildr stands 5'6" with a lean, sinewy frame, weighing about 140 pounds. Her pale skin is marked with fine ash-gray patterns—remnants of the fire from which she was pulled as an infant—giving her an otherworldly appearance. Her black hair is bound in a single intricate plait that reaches her waist. Her gray eyes are calm and distant, as though focused on something beyond the visible world. Her features are sharp and delicate, with high cheekbones, a narrow nose, thin lips, and dark brows that contrast strikingly with her pallid complexion. Her movements carry an unnatural stillness, as if the flames that forged her burned away all unnecessary motion. She wears layered robes of deep charcoal and rust, with a cuirass of blackened kurbul beneath, and carries a slender sword at her hip. An ember-shaped amulet of red gold hangs at her throat.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Brynhildr was found as a child amid the ashes of a great fire that had consumed her village. The only survivor, she was taken in by followers of Súrtr who saw her survival as a sign of divine favor. Raised in the harsh, fiery environment of Súrtr's worshippers, Brynhildr grew into a fierce and determined warrior, her skin forever marked by the ash from which she had emerged. She became known for her ability to move through fire unscathed, and for her calm, almost detached demeanor in the face of the most terrifying dangers.

Brynhildr's most famous saga tells of the time she led a band of warriors into the depths of a volcano to retrieve the Ember of Eternity, a powerful relic of Súrtr. The volcano was said to be guarded by a massive fire serpent, a creature born of Súrtr's own flames. Many had attempted the journey before, but none had returned. Undeterred, Brynhildr led her warriors through rivers of lava and walls of flame, her presence calming their fears. When they finally confronted the fire serpent, Brynhildr alone stepped forward to face it. Calling upon Súrtr's power, she absorbed the serpent's flames into her own body, leaving the creature weakened and allowing her warriors to strike it down. With the Ember of Eternity in hand, Brynhildr returned home, her skin glowing with the power of the flames she had conquered.

## Psyche

### Personality

Brynhildr is eerily calm, her voice rarely rising above a measured tone even in the heat of battle. She views fire not as destruction but as purification, and this philosophical conviction gives her a serenity that others find unsettling. She is deeply spiritual and spends hours in meditation before the sacred flames. She rarely smiles but is not unkind—she simply views the world through a lens of inevitable transformation, where all things must burn to be renewed.

### Motivation

Brynhildr seeks to understand the deeper mysteries of Súrtr's flame—not as a weapon of destruction, but as a force of renewal. She believes her survival as a child was not mere luck but a calling, and she strives to become a vessel through which Súrtr's purifying fire can cleanse the world of corruption. She is troubled by visions of a great conflagration that she cannot determine is prophecy or warning.

### Strengths

Brynhildr's ability to absorb and redirect fire is extraordinary, making her nearly immune to flame-based attacks. Her calm leadership under pressure inspires confidence in those who follow her, and her spiritual authority among Súrtr's faithful is second only to the high priests. She is a skilled combatant who fights with deliberate precision rather than wild ferocity, making her more dangerous than warriors who rely on rage alone.

## Social

## Companions

### Patrons

**The Ember Sisterhood**—A secretive order of Súrtr's priestesses who recognized Brynhildr's gifts and trained her in the deeper mysteries of fire magic. They provide her with sacred knowledge and ritual support.

**High Priest Asmund of Ashenmount**—The ranking priest at Súrtr's primary temple, who views Brynhildr as a potential successor and protects her from political enemies within the faith.

### Enemies

**Eldgrimr Flameheart**—A fellow devotee of Súrtr whose reckless interpretation of the god's will Brynhildr considers heretical. Their rivalry threatens to split the faithful.

**The Verdant Order**—A druidic circle that views all fire worship as an existential threat to the natural world. They have attempted to assassinate Brynhildr twice, seeing her growing power as particularly dangerous.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Ember's Burden**—Since absorbing the fire serpent's flames, Brynhildr has felt a growing heat within her that she cannot control. The Ember Sisterhood believes she is becoming a living vessel of Súrtr's power, but the transformation may consume her entirely if she cannot master it.

2. **The Ash Prophet**—A mysterious figure has appeared in the northern settlements, preaching that Brynhildr is the harbinger of the end times. Whether this prophet is an ally or enemy remains unclear, but their words are causing panic.

3. **Schism of Flame**—The tension between Brynhildr's contemplative approach and Eldgrimr's aggressive one has reached a breaking point. Both factions of Súrtr's faithful are arming for conflict, and someone must mediate before the faith tears itself apart.
