# Appearance {#appearance}

Valdrik stands 5'7" with a thin, almost gaunt frame, weighing about 140 pounds. His pale skin has an unhealthy pallor, and his dark blonde hair is wild and uncombed, sticking out at odd angles. His green eyes have a feverish intensity, darting constantly as though tracking things invisible to others. His features are sharp and pinched, with a narrow face, a pointed nose, hollow cheeks, thin lips that move constantly in muttered calculations, and brows knit in perpetual concentration. His hands are stained with alchemical reagents in a dozen different colors, and chemical burns dot his fingers. Valdrik wears a stained leather apron over threadbare scholar's robes, with pouches and vials dangling from every available surface. He smells faintly of sulfur and something metallic. The Forsaken Guardian – his created companion – is often lurking nearby, casting a monstrous shadow that contrasts sharply with Valdrik's slight form.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Valdrik was born to a clan of wanderers who revered Ymir for his creative genius, despite the god's indifference. From an early age, Valdrik was fascinated by the Dreadspawn – creations of Ymir that were both awe-inspiring and terrifying. While others feared these beings, Valdrik saw them as manifestations of Ymir's brilliance and sought to understand their nature. As he grew older, Valdrik became known as the Shaper for his ability to manipulate and alter these creations, seeking to perfect what Ymir had left incomplete. His experiments were dangerous and often led to disaster, but Valdrik was relentless in his pursuit of Ymir's ideals.

The saga of Valdrik the Shaper tells of his most ambitious experiment, where he attempted to combine the essence of two powerful Dreadspawn to create a new, more perfect being. The process was fraught with peril, as the Dreadspawn were unpredictable and volatile. Valdrik spent weeks preparing for the fusion, using ancient texts and forbidden knowledge to guide him. When the time came, he succeeded in merging the two beings, creating a new Dreadspawn that was both beautiful and terrifying – the Forsaken Guardian. This creation became a symbol of Valdrik's devotion to Ymir and his ability to bring order to chaos.

## Psyche

### Personality

Valdrik is obsessive and brilliant, a man whose mind operates on a different plane from ordinary people. He speaks in rapid, tangential bursts, jumping between subjects in ways that leave listeners bewildered. He is deeply uncomfortable with social interaction and prefers the company of his creations to that of people. Despite his eccentricity, Valdrik possesses a genuine desire to make the world better through his work, though his definition of 'better' often alarms those around him. He has no sense of personal danger and will cheerfully walk into life-threatening situations if they promise interesting results.

### Motivation

Valdrik seeks to complete what Ymir began – to perfect the art of creation itself. He believes that the Dreadspawn are not monsters but unfinished masterworks, and that with enough knowledge and skill, they can be elevated to something magnificent. His deeper drive is a need for meaning: if Ymir created without purpose, perhaps Valdrik can give that creation purpose after the fact.

### Strengths

Valdrik's understanding of the Dreadspawn is unparalleled; he can predict their behavior, communicate with them to some degree, and modify their physical forms. His alchemical and scholarly knowledge is vast, spanning disciplines that most scholars would consider mutually exclusive. The Forsaken Guardian he created serves as both protector and companion, a formidable creature that obeys his commands with surprising loyalty.

## Social

## Companions

### Patrons

**The Wanderers of Ymir** – The scattered followers of the Forsaken Creator who see Valdrik as the most promising practitioner of Ymir's creative arts and supply him with rare materials and forbidden texts.

**Professor Aldric of the Panepistemium** – A Panepistemium scholar who secretly funds Valdrik's research, fascinated by the practical applications of his work with the Dreadspawn despite the ethical concerns.

### Enemies

**The Ordo Arcanis** – The Ordo views Valdrik's unsanctioned manipulation of magical creatures as a serious threat and has dispatched Quaesitors to investigate his activities.

**The Dreadspawn Hunters** – A vigilante group dedicated to destroying all Dreadspawn, who view Valdrik as a dangerous madman whose work creates more monsters for the world to suffer.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Unfinished Creation** – Valdrik has discovered the remains of one of Ymir's original laboratories and believes he can reactivate it. The knowledge within could revolutionize his work – or unleash something terrible.

2. **The Guardian's Awakening** – The Forsaken Guardian has begun displaying independent thought and emotions. Valdrik must decide whether this is a breakthrough or a catastrophe.

3. **The Ordo's Ultimatum** – Quaesitors have arrived with an ultimatum: submit to the Ordo's authority or be destroyed. Valdrik must choose between his independence and his survival, or find a third option.
