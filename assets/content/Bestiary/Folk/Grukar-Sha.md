# Appearance {#appearance}

![[grkrsh|Grukar-Sha]]{float: top-left}

You almost missed it. Standing at the edge of the firelight, half-turned as though already leaving, is a figure that barely registers as a Grukar at all. It is thin—disturbingly thin, all sinew and angular bone beneath gray-green skin drawn tight as parchment. Perhaps four and a half feet tall, only slightly more than the common Uk, but where the Uk are squat and solid, this creature is narrow and sharp, built like a blade stood on its edge. Its eyes are what hold you: large for a Grukar, pale and quick, darting across the room with an intelligence that sits alien and unsettling in that tusked face. It carries no weapon you can see, though its long fingers move with a restless, deliberate precision that suggests it has several hidden about its person. When it speaks—and it is the only Grukar that speaks anything you can recognize as words—its voice arrives wrong. The mouth shapes the human syllables, but the resonance comes from somewhere deeper in the chest, a layer of tone the lips and jaw never produce in your own speech, and the result is a low pressure against your ribs that you feel before you fully understand the words. The massive [[being-grkrh|Grukar-Hai]] warlord beside it actually listens. You do too. You wish you did not.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Grukar-Sha are the brains of Grukar society, and they survive by making certain that no one ever thinks of them as a threat. Comprising roughly ten percent of the Grukar population, they are by far the weakest of the three subspecies in physical terms—thin, frail by Grukar standards, and hopelessly outmatched in any fair fight. But the Grukar-Sha have never fought a fair fight in their lives, and they have no intention of starting. Their gift is intelligence: a sharp, calculating cunning that sets them apart from every other Grukar as surely as the Hai's brute strength sets them apart. The Sha survive through two complementary strategies: making themselves indispensable to the powerful, and keeping everyone else too busy fighting each other to notice them. A Grukar-Sha whispering in the ear of a Grukar-Hai warlord is the true power behind many a tribal throne. They are scouts, spies, counselors, and poisoners—whatever role keeps them alive and in a position of quiet influence. They are the ones who stoke rivalries between competing Hai, who spread rumors among the Uk to prevent any dangerous solidarity, and who see to it that the tribal power structure always needs a clever advisor more than it needs another pair of fists.

The Sha are the only Grukar that can think ahead. An Uk hatches with everything it will ever know; a Hai learns readily enough, but only what a fight can teach it and only ever as tactics. A Sha alone sees forward—what a course will cost several moves hence, what another creature wants and how that wanting can be turned to some further purpose. To the rest of Grukar-kind this does not read as cleverness of a greater degree but very nearly as sorcery, and much of the dread a Sha collects is owed to that. It is also the only Grukar able to carry an idea home from beyond the tribe. And it is the only one that can recognize when a tribe is finished. An [[being-grkrahk|Ahk]] will manage a failing territory in good order all the way to the end rather than abandon it; when a tribe dies of famine or drought, any part of it that survives does so because some Sha saw the end coming, talked a second Sha and an aggrieved Hai into moving with it, and engineered the theft of a proto-Ahk to found a new tribe elsewhere. This is its worth and its sentence in one. Knowledge that stays in a single Sha's skull is lost to the tribe, so a Sha that comes to hold something the tribe cannot afford to lose is eventually invited to dinner—received in the spawn-chamber with full honors and there opened, so that its brain and nerves may be fed to the Ahk and what it knew written into the next clutch. A careful Sha therefore takes some trouble to appear no cleverer than it must, and the surest way to be rid of a rival is to let the spawn-chamber hear how much that rival has learned. At eighteen weeks, a Sha clutch is the slowest of any Grukar to hatch, so a Sha spent this way is not quickly replaced.

## Presentation

Grukar-Sha stand roughly four and a half to five feet tall—only marginally taller than the common [[being-grukaruk|Grukar-Uk]], but built along entirely different lines. Where the Uk are stocky and broad, the Sha are lean to the point of gauntness, with narrow shoulders, long limbs, and fingers that seem too dextrous for Grukar hands. Their skin is the same gray-green as their kin but tends toward paler, more mottled shades, often marked with subtle tattoos or paint for camouflage. Their features are sharper and more angular than other Grukar, with high cheekbones, pointed ears, and unusually large, pale eyes that miss nothing. They dress practically in dark, unassuming garments—nothing that draws attention—and carry small, easily concealed weapons: daggers, bone needles, vials of poison. They move with an economy of motion that can seem almost nervous, always positioning themselves near an exit, near a shadow, near a protector.

## Key Behaviors

A Grukar-Sha's first and most important skill is reading the room. They are constantly assessing who holds power, who wants power, who can be manipulated, and who is about to become dangerous. Their survival depends on staying one step ahead of the volatile politics of Grukar society, and they approach every dealing—even with allies—as a calculation. Among the Grukar-Hai, a Sha positions itself as an indispensable counselor: the voice of strategy that the Hai's own brutal temperament cannot provide. Among the Uk, a Sha plays the role of overseer, interpreter of the warlord's will, or simply the creature that knows things others do not. Their deepest art is the manipulation of conflict itself—seeding discord between potential rivals, redirecting aggression away from themselves and toward convenient targets, so that the tribal balance of power always requires a Sha to maintain. They are not cowards, precisely, but they are ruthlessly practical: if a situation turns violent, a Sha's first instinct is to see that someone else does the fighting. When cornered, they are surprisingly dangerous—not through strength, but through preparation, dirty tricks, and an intimate knowledge of exactly where to stick a knife.

## Combat Strategy

A Grukar-Sha rarely engages in open combat if avoidable. Instead, they strike from darkness, from unexpected angles, from positions of advantage. They attack isolated targets and attempt to divide enemy forces. They use poison extensively and focus on achieving objectives rather than killing everything. When forced into direct combat, they rely on speed, agility, and precision to overwhelm opponents through strikes at vital points. A single Grukar-Sha is dangerous; multiple Grukar-Sha are a coordinated assassination unit. They communicate through subtle signals and can coordinate complex multi-target strikes with minimal visible coordination.

## Attack Methods

### Dagger Strike

A quick, precise strike with a poisoned dagger aimed at vital areas. The Grukar-Sha flows away after striking, making retaliation difficult. The poison on the blade causes pain, paralysis, or sickness depending on what toxin is applied.

### Short Sword

A slashing or thrusting attack with a short sword used with economy of motion. The strikes are designed to disable and weaken rather than immediately kill, allowing multiple strikes to accumulate damage.

### Poison Projectile

The Grukar-Sha fires small darts, shuriken, or poisoned needles from concealment. The projectiles are accurate and coated with toxins that cause various effects.

### Ambush Attack

From hiding, the Grukar-Sha strikes a single target with full force focused on a vital point. These attacks are devastating when they land.

### Coordinated Assault

When multiple Grukar-Sha fight together, they coordinate strikes against isolated targets, overwhelming them through simultaneous attacks from multiple angles.

## Special Abilities

### Shadow Mastery

In dim light or darkness, the Grukar-Sha becomes nearly invisible. They can move through shadows and concealment with ease and speed that seems supernatural.

### Silent Movement

The Grukar-Sha can move without making sound, even on surfaces that should be noisy. This ability allows them to approach without warning.

### Precision Strike

Attacks by the Grukar-Sha are calculated for maximum effect on vital areas. Critical strikes, poisoning, and the choice of target are instinctive.

### Poison Knowledge

The Grukar-Sha understands poisons and toxins extensively. Weapons are usually coated with carefully chosen poisons for specific effects.

### Escape Artist

The Grukar-Sha is skilled at exiting situations—climbing, swimming, jumping from heights that would kill others, running across precarious terrain. Escape is always possible if the Grukar-Sha decides to flee.

### Hybrid Speech

Alone among Grukar, the Grukar-Sha can produce human-language speech. The sounds emerge from a partial use of the mouth combined with the chest- and throat-resonating structures common to all Grukar—never wholly mouth-shaped as a human's voice is, never wholly internal-resonance as another Grukar's signals are, but a blend of the two that arrives slightly out of phase with what the lips appear to be doing. The result is recognizable, grammatically functional human speech that feels physically wrong to a human listener: low chest-pressure carries through every sentence, and consonants resonate from places the speaker's mouth could not have produced them. Most humans describe sustained conversation with a Grukar-Sha as draining and unsettling in a way they cannot quite name. This is the capability that makes the Grukar-Sha the inter-tribal envoy and as the only Grukar a humanoid party can negotiate with at all.

## Additional Information

A Grukar-Sha encountered alone is almost certainly on a mission—scouting, spying, or carrying a message—and is the most negotiable of all Grukar subspecies. They are pragmatists to their marrow, and if offered something that serves their interests better than their current orders, they will consider it carefully. They can be bribed, bargained with, or even temporarily allied with, though trusting a Sha is a fool's game; they will honor an agreement exactly as long as it benefits them. They are the most likely Grukar to speak other languages, to understand the customs of civilized folk, and to pass through settlements without immediately resorting to violence. This makes them prized as emissaries and go-betweens, and deeply dangerous as infiltrators. The greatest threat a Grukar-Sha poses is not in combat but in the chaos they leave behind: a well-placed rumor, a poisoned well, a forged letter that turns allies against one another. When dealing with a Grukar tribe, eliminating or turning the Sha advisors can collapse the entire power structure—but finding them is the hard part, because they are very good at not being found until they want to be.
