# Appearance {#appearance}

![[lmnshd|Luminshade]]{float: top-left}

Where there is light, a shadow moves against it. Where there is darkness, a pale luminescence blooms. The figure is beautiful in the way that the edge of a knife is beautiful—precise, dangerous, and indifferent to your perception of it. Its form shifts between solid and translucent, and the longer you look at it, the harder it is to determine what you're actually seeing.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Luminshades are paradox creatures born where light and shadow meet in unusual proportion. They exist in the liminal spaces between day and night, in reflective surfaces and the gaps between stars. Unlike most spirits, they are not inherently malevolent, but their nature makes them incomprehensible to humans. A Luminshade may observe humans for months with no hostile intent, studying them as a scholar might study insects. Alternatively, it may decide on a whim that a particular person must be removed. They sometimes act as agents or messengers for more powerful entities, though their loyalty is questionable and their terms often incomprehensible.

## Presentation

A Luminshade is roughly human-shaped but clearly not human. Its body is composed of light and shadow in perfect balance—neither predominates, and both seem to shift independently. It stands about six feet tall, with limbs that are too long and graceful, and movements that seem to flow rather than step. Its face is smooth and featureless except for two points of luminescence where eyes should be—sometimes bright, sometimes dark, sometimes shifting between colors. The creature is semi-transparent, and through its body, the background becomes visible yet distorted, as if the world were seen through warped glass. It leaves no shadow when standing in light, and casts no glow when standing in darkness.

## Key Behaviors

Luminshades are curiosity-driven beings. They are drawn to places of change—battlefields, cities growing or shrinking, the boundaries between realms. They often appear at twilight or in places where light interacts strangely with architecture (mirrors, glass, water). By one account, Luminshades are collectors of memories or moments, gathering impressions of events they find aesthetically interesting. A Luminshade may protect a location it finds beautiful, or destroy one it finds ugly, with no regard for the humans inhabiting it. They do not hunt for food and do not require sleep. Their motivations, if they exist, are alien.

## Combat Strategy

Luminshades fight with creative, almost playful violence if forced into combat. They use their control over light and shadow to create confusion, with the goal of making combat more interesting rather than ending it quickly. They may refuse to fight a boring opponent, or press harder against a worthy one. They are not cowardly but they are vain; disabling their light-form can frustrate them enough to make them careless. They often break off a fight out of boredom rather than injury, deciding the encounter is no longer aesthetically interesting.

## Attack Methods

### Light Blast

The creature focuses its luminous form into a concentrated beam or burst of painful brightness. Victims struck by this attack feel as though they've stared into the sun; their eyes water and their vision becomes temporarily unclear. Multiple strikes can cause lasting eye damage.

### Shadow Strike

The creature draws the surrounding shadows toward itself and lashes out with tendrils of darkness. Unlike physical strikes, this attack leaves the victim feeling cold and diminished, as though some inner light has been drained away.

## Special Abilities

### Light Manipulation

The Luminshade can bend, redirect, and concentrate light in its vicinity with precision. It can create blindingly bright flashes, cause reflections to become mirrors that show false images, or redirect a beam of light to strike a specific target multiple times.

### Shadow Weaving

With equal finesse, the creature can manipulate darkness—deepening shadows to invisibility, creating zones of absolute darkness where light cannot penetrate, or forming solid-seeming shadows that slow or tangle those who attempt to move through them.

### Translocation Through Light

The Luminshade can move through reflective surfaces and directly between areas of light. It can step into a mirror and emerge from another, or move from one torch's glow to another torch's glow instantly. This ability only works between light sources that the creature can see.

### Paradox Nature

Being composed of equal parts light and shadow makes the Luminshade resistant to both darkness and light magic. However, it becomes more vulnerable when forced into a state of extreme shadow or extreme light—if surrounded only by darkness, or only by blinding brightness, it loses mobility and becomes vulnerable to attack.

## Additional Information

Luminshades are not evil and not good; they are aesthetic beings that care about beauty, symmetry, and interesting patterns. A Luminshade can sometimes be bargained with or negotiated with, but only on grounds that appeal to its sense of aesthetics. Offering to preserve something beautiful, or promising an interesting experience, may sway it. Threatening or harming something beautiful in its presence will enrage it far more effectively than direct challenge. A Luminshade defeated in combat often simply withdraws to wherever it came from, bearing no lasting grudge. Some communities have learned to coexist with local Luminshades by maintaining beautiful places and offering interesting events that keep the creatures engaged elsewhere.
