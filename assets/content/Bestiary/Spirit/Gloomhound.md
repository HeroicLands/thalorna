# Appearance {#appearance}

![[glmhnd|Gloomhound]]{float: top-left}

From the darkness comes a sound like no sound at all – a silence so absolute it presses against your ears. A shape coalesces, canine in outline but composed of shadow and void. Its eyes burn with a pale amber light, fixed on you with an animal’s hunger and something more – a predator’s calculation. The cold intensifies as it moves, and for just a moment you see its silhouette printed on the ground in frost that shouldn’t exist.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Gloomhounds are spectral predators born from the shadow realm, drawn to this world by dark ritual or lingering in places where death runs deep. They are semi-corporeal creatures that hunt in coordinated packs, using their strange connection to darkness and stone to ambush prey. Though they are primarily nocturnal, they may hunt in deep shadow or underground where darkness is constant. A Gloomhound encountered alone is likely driven or trapped; more often they come in threes or fours, each keenly aware of the others’ position without visible communication. They are intelligent creatures – they learn, they plan, and they understand vulnerability.

## Presentation

Each Gloomhound resembles a lean, wolf-like creature eight to nine feet from snout to tail tip, but composed of something between shadow and smoke. The body is only partially solid; light passes through it in strange ways, and edges blur and soften as though the creature were not quite fully here. Its eyes are the only clearly solid feature – bright amber or pale yellow, unblinking and aware. The fur, if it can be called that, ripples like water when the creature moves. In bright light, the Gloomhound becomes more distinct, more material; in shadow, it becomes nearly invisible. Its paws leave no prints on most surfaces, but on stone or metal, they leave faint impressions as though the creature briefly became denser at contact point.

## Key Behaviors

Gloomhounds are pack hunters with a well-ordered pack structure. They are most active in darkness but are not bound to it; they seem equally at home in caves, catacombs, and deep woods. When hunting, they move with eerie coordination, sometimes splitting to herd prey into waiting jaws. They do not kill wastefully – they understand the concept of exhausting prey before making the final attack. A pack will follow an injured creature for hours or days, allowing it to weaken from blood loss and terror before striking. They show strong territorial behavior and will defend their hunting grounds viciously against both other predators and humans.

## Combat Strategy

Gloomhounds use their semi-corporeal nature to devastating advantage. They dart through solid matter to flank opponents, move through walls to split a party, and withdraw through stone when a fight turns against them. Against light or holy magic, they become more cautious, relying on darkness and concealment rather than direct assault. In a pack, they coordinate their strikes – one attacks from the front while others position for flanking moves. They are smart enough to recognize weakness and will focus on isolated or injured opponents while avoiding those who wield light or holy power. When faced with multiple opponents wielding stone or holy weapons, they attempt to fragment the group and engage them separately.

## Attack Methods

### Ethereal Bite

The Gloomhound’s jaws close around a victim and the bite feels wrong – not normal tissue tearing, but a cold draining sensation as if something vital flows away. The wound is minor physically but the victim feels weakened at a fundamental level.

### Shadow Strike

A raking attack with shadow-wreathed claws that passes partially through armor and cloth. Where it strikes, the victim’s strength seems to diminish and their resolve wavers.

### Coordinated Ambush

The pack uses its telepathic bond to strike from multiple angles simultaneously. One attacks from the front while others emerge from stone or shadow to strike from flanking positions, overwhelming a single opponent.

## Special Abilities

### Phase Through Solid Matter

The Gloomhound can move through stone, wood, and worked metal as easily as walking through air. It can emerge from a wall mid-combat or retreat through solid ground. However, large quantities of stone – bedrock, living rock, naturally formed stone – slow or block its passage. Worked stone is no barrier, but unworked stone channels its movement.

### Telepathic Coordination

Pack members maintain a constant, silent communication that allows them to coordinate attacks without signal or sound. An individual Gloomhound separated from its pack loses this ability and becomes noticeably less effective.

### Shadow Form

In darkness or shadow, the Gloomhound is nearly invisible. In bright light, it becomes solid and distinct. The creature seems to partially exist in shadow rather than fully in the material world.

### Life Drain

Attacks by the Gloomhound drain vitality as well as wound. Victims feel a cold lethargy settle into their bones, their strength ebbing. The harm goes beyond the wound: it saps the life force itself.

## Additional Information

Gloomhounds are badly weakened by holy power and bright light. Holy magic burns them nearly as painfully as fire burns flesh. Stone weapons – especially naturally formed stone – disrupt their ability to phase through matter, leaving them more vulnerable. They can be deterred or driven off by sacred sites or places sanctified by priests of good-natured faiths. Creating areas of bright illumination can force them to retreat or become fully corporeal and vulnerable. Despite their predatory nature, Gloomhounds are not evil – they are simply hungry creatures following their nature. A few rangers have reported that a Gloomhound can be reasoned with, especially if its pack bonds are respected. A solitary Gloomhound may accept territory boundaries and leave isolated settlements alone if properly negotiated with. This is rare, but not unheard of.
