# Appearance {#appearance}

![[spctrwlf|Specterwolf]]{float: top-left}

In the darkness ahead, you hear what should be the sound of paws on stone – but the sound comes wrong, as if from a great distance even as the shape moves toward you. The form is wolflike but not quite solid; it seems to slip between shadows and reality with each step. Its eyes are pale and depthless, regarding you with an intelligence that no natural wolf should possess, and something about its presence makes your skin crawl with primal warning.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Specterwolves are the remnants of ancient beasts that died in places saturated with death and despair. They exist partially in the spirit realm, hunting on both sides of the veil between worlds. Some are wild predators; others are bound by dark magicians or haunted shamans as guardians or hunters. A Specterwolf pack is among the most terrifying threats to isolated travelers – coordinated, relentless, and able to move through obstacles that would stop normal wolves. They are intelligent enough to plan hunts and to learn from failures.

## Presentation

A Specterwolf is roughly the size of a large wolf, with a frame built for endurance hunting. Its body is semi-transparent and composed of mist and shadow, with a shimmer like heat haze that distorts the background. Its fur, when visible, appears matted and unkempt, as if it has been wet and dried many times. Its eyes are the sharpest feature – pale blue or silver, often seeming to glow with faint luminescence. Its mouth, when open, shows translucent fangs that look more substantial than the rest of its form. The creature leaves no footprints and produces little sound, and where it passes, the temperature drops noticeably.

## Key Behaviors

Specterwolves are pack hunters that display eerie coordination even without visible communication. They stalk prey with patience, sometimes following targets for days to exhaust them before attacking. Unlike natural wolves, they do not require sustenance in the normal way; they hunt from compulsion rather than hunger. They are most active at night and in shadow, and they seem to avoid direct sunlight. They show strong territorial behavior and will defend their hunting grounds viciously against both other predators and humans. A pack that has tasted blood in an area will return to that place repeatedly.

## Combat Strategy

Specterwolves use pack tactics to overwhelming advantage, attempting to surround and isolate opponents. They exploit their phasing ability to move through obstacles and attack from unexpected angles. One wolf attacks from the front while others emerge from shadows or stone to flank and attack. They are intelligent enough to recognize which opponents pose the most threat and will focus on disabling those first. Against light or holy magic, they become more cautious and may choose to hunt elsewhere. A single Specterwolf separated from its pack becomes noticeably less effective and may attempt to flee.

## Attack Methods

### Ethereal Bite

The wolf’s jaws close around a victim and the experience is nightmarish – teeth seem to pass partially through armor and flesh. The bite wounds feel cold and wrong, and the victim feels a deep draining sensation as if the attack reaches into their vitality itself. Multiple bites can leave a person unable to continue fighting or fleeing.

### Disarming Howl

The Specterwolf releases a cry that is both sound and something more – a keening that seems to vibrate at a fundamental level. Those who hear it directly experience vertigo, disorientation, and a momentary inability to coordinate themselves. Weapons may fall from weakened hands, and footing becomes uncertain.

## Special Abilities

### Phasing

The Specterwolf can move through stone, wood, and other solid obstacles as if they did not exist. It cannot move through barriers of living earth or unworked stone, which seem to impede it significantly. Worked stone, metal, and refined materials offer no resistance.

### Pack Coordination

Individual Specterwolves within a pack seem to share some form of connection that allows them to coordinate without visible communication. They position attacks with supernatural timing and support each other in combat with instinctive precision.

### Spirit Senses

The Specterwolf can see in complete darkness and can detect prey by their living essence rather than by sight or smell. It seems to sense emotional states and can track targets across ground that would be difficult for normal predators.

### Life Drain

The necrotic energy in the Specterwolf’s bite does more than wound – it saps the victim’s strength and vitality. Wounds inflicted by a Specterwolf are slow to heal and leave the victim feeling diminished even after physical recovery.

## Additional Information

Specterwolves are vulnerable to bright light and to weapons blessed or imbued with holy magic. Bright light drives them to ground and makes them less mobile and dangerous. A well-lit campfire can deter a pack, though determined wolves may simply wait for the light to fade. A few rangers and shamans claim that Specterwolves can be driven off or negotiated with if approached with the proper ritual respect. A Specterwolf pack killed in its territory may reform after several days, particularly if the source of its manifestation is not addressed. Permanent destruction requires either destroying the binding object if one exists, or cleansing the location of the death and despair that created the creatures.
