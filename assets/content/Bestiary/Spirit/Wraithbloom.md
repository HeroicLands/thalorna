# Appearance {#appearance}

![[wrthblm|Wraithbloom]]{float: top-left}

At the edge of the clearing stands a bloom that should not exist in this season, in this place. It hovers above the ground without roots or support, its petals translucent and glowing with a light that seems to come from within rather than reflected. As you watch, the petals move with grace, as though dancing to music only it can hear. The beauty of it is almost painful—it draws the eye and stirs something deep in the chest, an ache that is part longing and part dread. When you take a step forward, you are not entirely sure why.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Wraithblooms are the spirits of ancient plants—flowers and vines from places where magic saturated the earth so completely that death became merely another form of growth. They are not creatures in the traditional sense but animated expressions of the places they inhabit. A Wraithbloom is often found in old, magical groves or sacred gardens where the barrier between the living and spirit realms has worn thin. They are neither hostile nor benign but rather indifferent to human presence. They will defend their territory if threatened, but otherwise they seem content to exist in their own form of slow meditation.

## Presentation

A Wraithbloom is a hovering assemblage of spectral plants—translucent petals forming a corona around a central cluster of ghostly vines and stamens. The whole construction is roughly three to five feet in diameter and floats a few feet above the ground, though it sometimes descends to brush its vines across soil or flower. The petals glow softly in shades of pale blue, lavender, or sickly green, and this light shifts subtly moment to moment. The central bloom contains eyes or at least optical organs—two pale luminescent points that regard observers with what seems like curiosity or judgment. The creature smells faintly of both flowers and decay, and pollen drifts from it constantly, creating a visible haze in still air.

## Key Behaviors

Wraithblooms are rooted to locations—not physically, but spiritually. A particular Wraithbloom will haunt the same grove or garden for years or decades, slowly expanding its presence, encouraging the growth of more plants and trees. They are drawn to areas of natural beauty and to places where humans have tended gardens with love. They are most active at night and in shade, becoming more ethereal and less visible in bright sunlight. They seem to perceive and remember individual humans, responding differently to repeat visitors. A human who tends the garden and shows respect will be largely ignored; one who damages plants or shows disrespect will be actively opposed.

## Combat Strategy

Wraithblooms do not seek combat but will engage if their territory is threatened. They use their mobility and spectral nature to evade attacks while employing their pollen and vines to disable or entangle opponents. They are not vicious—they seek to drive away intruders rather than to kill them. Against opponents who persist in damaging the garden or themselves, they become more aggressive. They are intelligent enough to recognize when an opponent is too dangerous and will retreat into the deepest parts of their territory or even phase partially into the spirit realm.

## Attack Methods

### Spectral Vines

The Wraithbloom extends thorny, spectral vines that wind around victims, constricting and drawing them toward the flower's central bloom. The vines pass through normal armor partially, and victims report feeling both physical entanglement and a draining sensation as the plant draws their life energy through the thorns.

### Toxic Pollen

The Wraithbloom releases clouds of luminescent pollen that induces hallucinations, drowsiness, and confusion. Those who inhale deeply find themselves lost in waking dreams, unable to distinguish reality from vision. Prolonged exposure can lead to complete incapacitation.

### Life Drain

When a victim is entangled by vines or thoroughly inhales the pollen, the Wraithbloom begins drawing their life force directly. The process is slow but inexorable—victims feel their strength and will diminishing over time, as if the plant is feeding on their essence.

## Special Abilities

### Spectral Nature

The Wraithbloom is partially incorporeal and resistant to physical weapon strikes. Weapons pass through it with reduced effectiveness. Fire, sunlight, and light-based magic all harm it badly.

### Pollen Cloud

The creature can release its pollen in a controlled cloud that fills a specific area. Those within the cloud experience hallucinations drawn from their own fears and desires. The pollen also causes drowsiness and reduced mental acuity.

### Plant Regeneration

The Wraithbloom can draw energy from plants in its vicinity to heal wounds and restore itself. In a garden or forest, this ability makes it almost impossible to outlast in combat.

### Territorial Bond

The Wraithbloom is deeply connected to a specific place and gains strength when within its territory. Outside its original location, it becomes weaker and more vulnerable. It cannot truly leave—if separated too far from its location, it begins to fade.

## Additional Information

Fire is the most effective weapon against a Wraithbloom, as it destroys the plant matter that comprises its form. Sunlight also harms it badly, and light-based magic is effective. A Wraithbloom can sometimes be negotiated with if approached respectfully. It seems to understand human speech, though it does not speak in return. A human who tends the garden, removes invasive species, and shows respect for the space may actually gain the Wraithbloom's protection. A few rangers and druids have formed partnerships with Wraithblooms, allowing the spirit to nourish their plants in exchange for protection and care. A Wraithbloom is difficult to kill permanently because it is tied to the location it inhabits—killing it merely causes it to reform after several seasons. True destruction requires either burning the location and removing all plant life, or cleansing the land through ritual so that the magic sustaining the spirit dissipates.
