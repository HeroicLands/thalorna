# Appearance {#appearance}

![[phntmwng|Phantomwing]]{float: top-left}

A shape moves across the sky that shouldn't be there – too pale, too thin, too wrong. When it passes between you and the sun, the shadow it casts is not quite the shape of a bird, and sunlight seems to pass through it in odd ways. The sound of its wings reaches you only after it has already passed, a susurrus like wind through a tomb. There is sadness in its presence, the way a funeral bell carries meaning beyond mere sound.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Phantomwings are the spirits of creatures that died far from their birthplace – great birds that fell over foreign lands, or creatures whose connections to home were severed before death. They exist in a state of perpetual search, seeking a place they can no longer reach. They are not inherently hostile, but they are desperately lonely, and sometimes they pursue living beings in the hope of companionship or guidance. A Phantomwing may follow a caravan for weeks seeking only the sound of living voices. Alternatively, they may become violent, unable to accept that the world has moved on without them.

## Presentation

A Phantomwing has the general shape of a large raptor or eagle, with a wingspan approaching fifteen feet, but the form is composed of pale luminescence and semi-visible matter. It is almost transparent, and the landscape beyond shows through its body, though always slightly distorted as if seen through frosted glass. Its wings are tattered and worn, as though it has been flying through storms and through centuries. Its eyes are the sharpest part of its form – large and distinctly present, usually luminous pale blue or gray, and containing an overwhelming sadness. When it moves, the air seems to waver, and sometimes it cannot be seen at all, only the wake it leaves in the air.

## Key Behaviors

Phantomwings are solitary and nocturnal by preference, though they sometimes become active during overcast days when shadows are deep. They are drawn to high places – peaks, cliffs, and high towers – from which they seem to search the landscape endlessly. They do not hunt living creatures for food; they simply drift and search. If a Phantomwing becomes fixated on a person, it will follow them persistently, sometimes protectively. Some tales speak of Phantomwings guiding lost travelers to safety, while others describe them leading people into dangerous places in confusion about what they were doing. They are harmless until something triggers aggression – usually, the attempt to capture them or direct them elsewhere.

## Combat Strategy

Phantomwings do not seek combat. If forced into it, they become desperate and dangerous, but they would prefer to flee. They use their intangibility to avoid strikes and retreat to open sky. If cornered, a Phantomwing becomes vicious and will attack the source of its entrapment with focused fury. It fights with less cunning than material creatures – it lashes out in desperate patterns rather than executing strategy. Against opponents who cannot harm it (those without magical or blessed weapons), it ignores them entirely and seeks only to escape.

## Attack Methods

### Ethereal Talons

The spirit extends its claws and rakes them across a victim. The claws pass partially through normal matter but connect with supernatural force. The wounds are not deep physically, but they leave the victim feeling as though part of their essence has been torn away.

### Spectral Screech

The Phantomwing emits a sound like wind through broken glass and a creature's final cry combined. Those who hear it directly experience overwhelming sadness and disorientation. Victims find themselves unable to move with purpose, frozen by the weight of the creature's grief.

## Special Abilities

### Phasing

The Phantomwing exists partially out of synchronization with the material world. Physical weapons pass through it with minimal effect. However, magical and holy attacks strike it fully, as does the touch of blessed weapons.

### Aerial Mastery

The creature is at home in the sky in a way that nothing material can match. In open air, it gains tremendous advantage in mobility and combat positioning.

### Mournful Presence

Simply being near a Phantomwing for extended periods causes melancholy and despair. Those in close proximity for more than an hour begin to suffer from sadness and fatigue. Companions become irritable and withdrawn. This is the natural effect of prolonged exposure to such overwhelming grief, not a supernatural compulsion.

### Incorporeal Vision

The Phantomwing can perceive the world in ways that material creatures cannot. It can see through mist and fog, detect emotional auras, and sense disturbances in the spiritual realm.

## Additional Information

Phantomwings are often the harbingers of strange weather or magical phenomena. Their presence sometimes indicates that the boundary between the living world and the spirit realm is thin. Clerics and good-natured magic users sometimes attempt to help Phantomwings find peace, guiding them back to their homeland or granting them release from their search. Some who have succeeded report deep gratitude, with the Phantomwing's presence lingering protectively over those who helped it. A Phantomwing killed does not remain dead – it simply manifests again later, still searching. Permanent peace requires spiritual resolution, not violence.
