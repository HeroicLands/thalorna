# Appearance {#appearance}

![[frostjaw|Frostjaw]]{float: top-left}

Your breath mists in air that should be warmer. A shape materializes from white snow and whiter fog – four-legged and deadly, composed of living ice and frosted air. Its fur, if it can be called that, is crystalline and brittle, and every step it takes cracks the frozen ground beneath it. Its breath is visible and freezing, and the space around it seems to age and become brittle with unnatural cold. When it opens its mouth, you see teeth of ice and something older, something that existed before fire ever warmed the world.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Frostjaws are predators of ice and cold, manifestations of winter itself given animal form. They hunt in frozen lands and are drawn to the deepest cold. Some are natural creatures of elemental nature; others are summoned or bound by sorcerers. A Frostjaw is driven as much by hunger as by territorial aggression, and it will pursue prey across frozen wastes with relentless determination. In the proper environment – deep winter, glacial regions, frozen peaks – a Frostjaw is nearly unstoppable.

## Presentation

A Frostjaw resembles a large, powerful wolf ten to twelve feet in length, but composed of living ice and magical cold rather than flesh and fur. Its body is crystalline and translucent in places, with patterns of frost that shift like clouds within clear ice. Its eyes are pale blue or frosted white, and they burn with intelligence and hunger. Its breath is visible and freezing, and it leaves trails of deepened frost and ice-patterns where it passes. Where it walks, the ground becomes more brittle, and water freezes instantly beneath its paws.

## Key Behaviors

Frostjaws are solitary hunters that claim frozen territories and defend them against all intruders. They are drawn to sources of living heat – warm-blooded animals, settlements with fires, humans. They seem to delight in the contrast between heat and cold, pursuing the prey that gives off the most warmth. They are intelligent and patient, willing to stalk prey for days if necessary. In their native cold, they are supremely confident. Away from cold, they become more aggressive and more dangerous, as though fighting against their nature.

## Combat Strategy

A Frostjaw attacks with a combination of speed and control, using its freezing abilities to slow and disable opponents before moving in for the kill. It uses terrain advantage – snow, ice, frozen obstacles – to control the battlefield. It will attempt to separate and isolate opponents, attacking isolated targets with overwhelming force. Against fire and heat-based magic, it becomes more cautious and evasive. In extreme heat, a Frostjaw becomes desperate and dangerous, fighting with furious intensity.

## Attack Methods

### Frost Bite

The Frostjaw's jaws close with crushing force, and the victim is simultaneously crushed and frozen. The bite crushes bone and introduces freezing cold into the victim's body. Victims struck feel their strength and mobility deteriorating from the intense cold.

### Freezing Breath

The Frostjaw exhales a torrent of sub-zero air and crystalline ice that engulfs everything in its path. Victims caught in the breath become partially frozen, their movements slowing dramatically. Prolonged exposure can result in complete crystallization.

### Shatter Strike

The Frostjaw strikes a frozen opponent or frozen ground and uses the brittle nature of ice to do the worst harm it can. The strike shatters frozen enemies or creates dangerous shards of ice that spread additional cold.

## Special Abilities

### Glacial Resilience

The Frostjaw's body is composed of living ice, making it naturally resistant to cold. Fire and heat harm it, but it is nearly immune to cold-based magic. Physical weapons are less effective due to the hardness and regenerative nature of its icy form.

### Frozen Territory

In places of extreme cold, the Frostjaw draws strength from the environment, becoming more powerful and more dangerous. In regions of deep winter or glacial ice, it is nearly unstoppable.

### Freezing Aura

The ambient temperature near a Frostjaw drops dramatically. Exposed skin begins to freeze, and movement becomes sluggish. Prolonged exposure causes frostbite and hypothermia.

### Winter's Curse

The Frostjaw can permanently lower the temperature in a region, causing accelerated freezing. Water freezes solid, vegetation dies, and the land becomes more and more like the creature's native habitat. A Frostjaw that remains in a location long enough can transform the entire region into frozen wasteland.

## Additional Information

Fire and heat are the Frostjaw's primary weaknesses. A large source of heat can harm it significantly, and sustained fire-based magic can reduce its power. A Frostjaw cannot survive in regions of sustained heat and will retreat to colder climates. A Frostjaw destroyed in a warm location may not reform. One destroyed in its native frozen territory will likely return after several seasons. Permanent destruction requires either keeping it away from cold sources until it weakens to death, or collapsing it into warming water or burying it in earth warmed from below.
