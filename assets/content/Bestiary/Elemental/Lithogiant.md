# Appearance {#appearance}

![[lthgnt|Lithogiant]]{float: top-left}

The ground trembles. What rises before you is the size of a house, then larger—a humanoid figure of solid stone and living earth, perhaps twenty-five to thirty feet in height. Its body is composed of massive interlocked stone blocks and carved rock, with a silhouette of geological strata made animate. Where it moves, the earth shakes, and small stones rattle and bounce from the vibration. Its eyes are burning points deep within a stone head, and when it shifts its weight, entire hillsides seem to shift with it. It regards you with the alien patience of something that measures time in ages of stone.

# Dossier {#dossier}

A Lithogiant is raw elemental power—an earth elemental of titanic proportions. It is not bound to a specific location but wanders across mountain ranges and high plateaus, following paths that only it understands. Most Lithogiants are solitary and avoid human settlements, but an agitated or territorial one can be an apocalyptic threat to entire regions. A Lithogiant does not hunt; it simply moves according to its own imperatives. Anything in its path is an obstacle to be removed.

## Presentation

A Lithogiant stands twenty-five to thirty feet tall and is composed entirely of stone and earth held together by magic. Its body has a roughly humanoid shape—two legs, a torso, two arms, and a head—but the proportions are strange, shifted toward strength and endurance rather than human likeness. Its surface is jagged and rough, with exposed stone faces and geological patterns visible across its body. Its eyes are deep within its head, burning with a dull orange or red glow. Its hands are massive and stone, and its stride can crack the earth.

## Key Behaviors

Lithogiants are slow-moving but inexorable. They seem to follow invisible paths across mountain ranges, and they seem drawn to places of geological interest—ancient stones, sites of past earthquakes, places where the earth's power is evident. They are not territorial in the normal sense, but they will not tolerate being blocked or redirected. They seem to have no need for food, sleep, or rest. They simply move, endure, and exist. Most encounters involve a Lithogiant passing through a region—the threat being not active aggression but simple unstoppable motion.

## Combat Strategy

A Lithogiant does not fight tactically or with cunning. It moves toward its destination regardless of obstacles. If attacked, it defends itself with straightforward, overwhelming force. It will not pursue fleeing opponents but will systematically crush any obstacle that remains in its path. It is too slow to catch fast-moving enemies and does not attempt to do so. It is nearly impossible to injure seriously and continues moving even when partially damaged.

## Attack Methods

### Crushing Blows

The Lithogiant swings an arm or strikes with a hand, and the impact is apocalyptic. The blow carries the weight and momentum of a moving mountain. Victims struck are instantly killed or catastrophically injured. Objects struck are reduced to rubble.

### Seismic Stomp

The Lithogiant raises a foot and brings it down with world-shaking force. The impact creates localized earthquakes that ripple outward, causing buildings to collapse, ground to crack, and mounted enemies to be thrown. The effect can extend for hundreds of feet.

### Rock Throw

The Lithogiant picks up boulders or tears chunks from the landscape and hurls them at targets. These projectiles are massive enough to crush buildings and can strike with lethal force against even well-protected targets.

### Ground Manipulation

The Lithogiant can cause the ground beneath it to shift and buckle, creating obstacles, chasms, or unstable terrain that makes movement difficult for smaller creatures.

## Special Abilities

### Titanic Strength

The Lithogiant's physical strength is beyond the scale of normal creatures. It can move boulders that weigh hundreds of tons, reshape landscapes, and destroy buildings with casual effort.

### Seismic Presence

Simply existing, the Lithogiant causes the earth to tremble. Structures nearby experience constant minor earthquakes, and the ground becomes increasingly unstable in areas where it spends time.

### Earth Elemental Resilience

The Lithogiant is composed of stone and is nearly indestructible. It regenerates from earth-based magic and is only truly harmed by water-based magic, which can erode and crack it, or by air-based magic, which can scatter its components.

### Geological Awareness

The Lithogiant seems to perceive the earth on a level that humans cannot. It knows the structure of mountains and can sense where the earth is strange. It may move according to knowledge of earthquakes or upheavals about to occur.

## Additional Information

Water is the Lithogiant's primary vulnerability. Large bodies of flowing water can erode it, and sustained water-based magic can crack and damage its form. Settling it into a deep river or causing a flood can harm it significantly. Air-based magic that can scatter its stone components is also effective. A Lithogiant destroyed by dispersal or sinking cannot easily reform. One destroyed on solid earth may regenerate given enough time. Most encounters with Lithogiants cannot be won through combat; the goal is instead to get out of the creature's path or to redirect it toward a hazard (a chasm, a river, a flood). One school of philosophy holds that Lithogiants serve a purpose in reshaping the world according to deeper geological principles beyond human understanding, and that killing one may have consequences beyond the obvious.
