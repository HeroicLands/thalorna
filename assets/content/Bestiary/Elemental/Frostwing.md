# Appearance {#appearance}

![[frstwng|Frostwing]]{float: top-left}

High above, a shape circles on wings that catch the light wrongly. The Frostwing is beautiful in the way that predators are beautiful—economical, purposeful, terrible. Its wings seem to be made of crystalline ice, refracting light into patterns that hurt to watch directly. As it banks and turns, frost crystals trail behind it like the wake of a ship. The air grows colder as it approaches, and you realize with creeping horror that the temperature is dropping far faster than it should, faster than wind and altitude should account for.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Frostwings are aerial hunters of ice and cold, patrolling regions of deep winter and bringing death from above. They are migratory, following the seasons to where cold is deepest. They are intelligent predators that hunt in coordinated groups, using aerial tactics to outmaneuver ground-based prey. A single Frostwing is dangerous; a pair is nearly unstoppable. They seem to view smaller creatures as simple prey and show no compunction about raiding settlements or attacking caravans.

## Presentation

A Frostwing is a large, eagle-like creature with a wingspan of twenty to twenty-five feet. Its feathers appear to be made of crystalline ice that catches and refracts light beautifully. Its body is sleek and built for speed, and its movements in the air are fluid and graceful. Its eyes are bright sapphire blue, and they are far more intelligent than any normal bird. Its talons are sharp and frozen solid, and where they touch, frost spreads. Its breath is visible as it moves—cold air crystallizing in its wake.

## Key Behaviors

Frostwings are nomadic, following prey herds and moving toward regions of increasing cold with the approach of winter. They hunt during the day, using their aerial advantage to locate warm-blooded prey. They are social with their own kind and often hunt in pairs or small groups, using coordinated tactics. They are intelligent enough to understand human settlements and to learn when easy prey is available. A Frostwing may repeatedly raid a settlement if not actively driven away. They seem to view all non-sapient creatures as food.

## Combat Strategy

Frostwings fight from the air, using their mobility to strike and withdraw before enemies can effectively respond. They use freezing attacks to slow and disable opponents, then move in for killing strikes. They are tactical enough to focus on isolated opponents, disabled opponents, or those furthest from threats. A Frostwing will attempt to gain altitude advantage and will avoid direct melee if possible. Against opponents with ranged attacks or fire-based magic, they become more cautious and may disengage to find other prey.

## Attack Methods

### Icy Talons

The Frostwing dives and strikes with talons that are sharp and frozen. The talons cut deep, and the cold penetrates the wound. Victims report that wounds from Frostwing talons are difficult to heal and leave areas of persistent numbness.

### Freezing Breath

The Frostwing exhales a cone of crystalline air that freezes everything it touches. The attack can immobilize a victim or partially freeze them, making them vulnerable to follow-up attacks. Against multiple opponents, the creature may use the breath to force them into difficult positions.

### Ice Shard Barrage

The Frostwing causes ice to form in the air around itself and hurls it at opponents. The shards are sharp enough to cut, and the cold in them does more harm than the wound itself.

## Special Abilities

### Aerial Mastery

The Frostwing is supremely at home in the sky. In open air, its positioning and mobility are beyond anything a ground-based creature can match.

### Freezing Aura

The presence of a Frostwing lowers the ambient temperature dramatically. The cold radiates outward, making movement difficult and every physical effort slower.

### Cold Resistance

The Frostwing is naturally resistant to cold and immune to normal ice-based attacks. Fire and heat are the only elements that can harm it.

### Localized Blizzard

The Frostwing can create a localized blizzard in an area, reducing visibility to near zero and creating severe wind. The effect is most pronounced in cold climates and near water where moisture can freeze.

## Additional Information

Fire and heat are the Frostwing's primary vulnerabilities. Fire-based magic is significantly more effective against it than against other ice creatures, possibly because of the contrast between its natural cold and the heat. Archers with flaming arrows have had some success against Frostwings. They cannot survive in regions of sustained heat and will avoid such areas. A Frostwing destroyed in warm climates may not reform. Attempts to hunt or trap Frostwings using lures have been moderately successful; the creatures' predatory instinct sometimes overrides caution. Some settlements have learned to protect themselves by maintaining large fires on rooftops, which the Frostwings avoid.
