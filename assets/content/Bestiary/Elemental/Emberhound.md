# Appearance {#appearance}

![[embrhnd|Emberhound]]{float: top-left}

The stone beneath your feet grows uncomfortably warm. A shape emerges from the heat-haze of the horizon—four-legged, wolf-like, but composed of fire and ember rather than flesh. Its eyes are steady yellow flames that fix on you with predatory intelligence. Where its paws strike the ground, the earth blackens and cracks. The heat it radiates grows stronger as it nears, and your skin begins to feel the burn of a forge drawing near.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Emberhounds are elementals of pure fire given temporary animal form, most often summoned by ancient sorcerers or bound to places of power. They are not mindless—they think, they hunt, and they understand tactics. An Emberhound is as much predator as elemental, combining the cunning of a beast with the destructive force of living flame. Some are bound as guardians; others roam wild, driven by hunger for fuel. A lone Emberhound is dangerous; a pack is a force of nature.

## Presentation

An Emberhound resembles a large, muscular hound eight to ten feet in length, but composed entirely of living flame and burning coal. Its body is a constantly shifting mass of orange, yellow, and white fire held in the rough shape of a canine. Its eyes are solid yellow flames that burn with steady intelligence. Its fur appears to be made of embers that glow and flare with its movements. Where it passes, the ground blackens and cracks from heat. It leaves no paw prints—only scorch marks and sometimes small fires that spread from the intensity of its passage.

## Key Behaviors

Emberhounds are territorial and aggressive, claiming hunting grounds and defending them against all intruders. They hunt actively, pursuing prey across open ground and cornering them with cunning. They seem to require fuel to sustain themselves—they are drawn to areas of combustible material and will consume fire where they find it, growing stronger from it. They are intelligent enough to understand human commands if taught during binding or if treated as partners rather than mere beasts. Most wild Emberhounds are driven by hunger and will attack on sight, but an Emberhound that respects a human master will follow their commands with ferocious loyalty.

## Combat Strategy

Emberhounds fight with aggressive directness, pursuing prey with relentless determination. They use their speed and strength to close distance quickly, then overwhelm opponents with powerful bites and burning attacks. They show no fear of fire-based magic and will actually move toward such attacks to absorb them. Against cold or water-based magic, they become more cautious and evasive. In a territory where fire has spread, they fight more effectively, growing stronger from the flames around them. They are intelligent enough to recognize a losing battle and will flee if seriously wounded, retreating to cool water or broken ground.

## Attack Methods

### Fiery Bite

The Emberhound's jaws clamp down with crushing force, and the victim is seared by the intense heat of flames in their mouth. The bite causes both physical damage from the force of the bite and severe thermal burns from the flames, leaving the victim scorched and weakened.

### Flaming Breath

The Emberhound exhales a cone of flames that engulfs everything in its path. The attack is devastating to multiple targets and can ignite surrounding materials, spreading fire through an area and creating additional hazards.

### Tail Whip

The creature swings its burning tail like a weapon, striking with surprising force and leaving trails of flame. The tail can knock a person off their feet or ignite their clothing and armor.

## Special Abilities

### Fire Absorption

The Emberhound can absorb fire-based magical attacks and heal from them. A fireball or flame strike that would harm another creature instead restores the Emberhound's vitality. This makes most fire-based magic tactics ineffective.

### Thermal Resistance

The Emberhound is naturally resistant to physical damage, and its fiery form makes it difficult for normal weapons to strike effectively. Fire cannot harm it at all; cold and water-based magic are the primary things that can hurt it.

### Heat Aura

Simply existing near an Emberhound is dangerous. The ambient temperature rises dramatically within thirty feet, and exposed skin burns from proximity. Flammable materials ignite if too close. Metal weapons become too hot to hold, and prolonged exposure can cause heat exhaustion.

### Ember Trail

Where the Emberhound moves, fire follows. Its passage leaves burning marks on the ground and sets combustible materials aflame. In a dry environment, these scattered fires can combine into a significant conflagration.

## Additional Information

Cold and water are the Emberhound's greatest weaknesses. A large enough body of water can immobilize one, and sustained cold-based magic can reduce its power. An Emberhound cannot cross a barrier of cold iron, and some defensive fortifications use this fact. An Emberhound that is offered respect and allowed to consume fuel may become less aggressive and more predictable. Some organizations bind Emberhounds as guardians, feeding them regularly in exchange for their protection. An Emberhound destroyed in water or extreme cold may not reform, depending on how it was created. One destroyed in its natural territory will reform after several days unless the source of its power is explicitly severed.
