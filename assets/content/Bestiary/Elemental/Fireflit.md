# Appearance {#appearance}

![[fireflit|Fireflit]]{float: top-left}

A spark catches your eye, bright as a meteor. What you see is smaller than your hand – a creature of pure flame shaped vaguely like a dragonfly or fairy, with wings that beat so fast they blur into solid patterns of light. It zips through the air with startling speed, leaving a trail of sparks and heat in its wake. The sound of it is like a crackling fire and a high-pitched keening combined. If it lingers, you can feel the heat on your skin; it seems to generate warmth entirely out of proportion to its size.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Fireflits are small fire elementals, quick and clever, often acting as scouts, messengers, or servants for larger entities. They are not mindless – they play tricks, they remember faces, and they show preference for certain individuals. Some Fireflits are bound into service; others are wild and roam as they wish. A single Fireflit is rarely a serious threat but can be extraordinarily annoying. A swarm of them is dangerous. They are attracted to excitement, chaos, and sources of flame, and they seem to take delight in mischief and small acts of destruction.

## Presentation

A Fireflit is roughly the size of a hand or a large bird, composed entirely of living fire. Its body is a slender, vaguely reptilian shape with wings like crystalline flame that beat hundreds of times per second. Its eyes are bright points of intense heat, and its movements are liquid and impossibly fast. The creature produces a constant soft crackling sound and leaves briefly-lasting trails of sparks as it moves. In darkness, its glow is blindingly bright; in bright light, it is still vivid and distinct.

## Key Behaviors

Fireflits are curious and playful, attracted to shiny objects, bright lights, and sources of flame. They are mischievous and enjoy causing small pranks and minor chaos. They show surprising intelligence and awareness of their environment. They are highly social with others of their kind and often travel in small groups or pairs. When bound to service, they take their duties seriously but never lose their playful streak. A Fireflit can merge with larger flames and will do so to hide, rest, or escape danger.

## Combat Strategy

Fireflits rarely engage in serious combat against larger foes. Instead, they harass with speed and evasion, using their incredible mobility to strike and withdraw faster than attacks can follow. They work together in groups, attacking from multiple angles and overwhelming opponents through coordinated strikes. Against single opponents with water or ice abilities, they become cautious and may flee. In areas full of potential fuel (dry grass, wooden buildings, etc.), they become more aggressive, using the environment to create additional hazards and escape routes.

## Attack Methods

### Fire Breath

The Fireflit exhales a small but extremely hot cone of flame. The attack can ignite flammable materials and cause painful burns on exposed skin. Multiple Fireflits using this simultaneously create a significant hazard.

### Scorching Touch

The Fireflit darts in and makes contact with exposed skin or materials, transferring its heat through direct contact. The burn is localized but intense, and flammable materials can ignite from a single touch.

### Fiery Wing Strike

The Fireflit's wings, when moved at full speed, create sharp edges of flame that can cut and burn. These strikes are less damaging than the breath or touch but rapid and difficult to defend against.

## Special Abilities

### Preternatural Speed

The Fireflit moves at speeds that make it difficult to track. It can change direction instantly and position itself for attacks while opponents are still following its last movement. No normal physical attack can follow its movements.

### Merge with Flames

The Fireflit can merge with any fire larger than itself, becoming invisible and protected within the flames. It can move through connected fires instantly, using them as highways and hiding places. Extinguishing the fire forces it out.

### Heat Aura

The Fireflit generates intense localized heat. Areas it occupies grow warm, and flammable materials near it may ignite spontaneously if it remains too long. The heat is not uniform but concentrated around its body.

### Fire Empathy

The Fireflit can sense and communicate with other fire-based creatures and with living flames. It can encourage fires to spread and seems to negotiate with larger fire elementals on equal terms.

## Additional Information

Water and ice are the Fireflit's primary weaknesses. A single bucket of water or a well-aimed ice spell can extinguish a Fireflit instantly. They are also vulnerable in non-flammable environments with no larger fires to merge with. Fireflits can be negotiated with or even befriended if approached respectfully, especially if offered sources of flame or shiny objects. Some organizations keep bound Fireflits as messengers or scouts. A wild Fireflit treated as an equal rather than a threat may choose to help rather than hinder. A Fireflit extinguished is simply gone; they do not reform. This makes them the only fire elementals that have a final, permanent death.
