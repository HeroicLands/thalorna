# Appearance {#appearance}

![[kmdbhmth|Komodo Behemoth]]{float: top-left}

A shadow moves across the rocky ground—enormous, inexorable, patient. The air grows warmer as the massive shape draws close, and the smell reaches you first: stale, meaty, and laced with something rotten. The creature slides into view with terrifying grace for something so vast, its scales catching the light in dull, metallic flashes. The ground trembles with each footfall. Its forked tongue emerges and retracts, tasting your fear on the wind, and its eyes—ancient, knowing, pitiless—lock onto yours as the tail sweeps behind it like a felled tree.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Komodo Behemoth is a titanic reptilian predator measuring 15 to 18 feet in length and weighing well over a ton. Its body is a mass of rippling muscle beneath mottled scales in shades of dark gray and green that shift in coloration depending on age and environment. Its head is broad and flattened, positioned at the end of a thick, powerful neck, with a mouth that can unhinge to an alarming degree. Its four legs are stocky and immensely powerful, ending in clawed feet that leave deep prints in soil and rock. Its tail, nearly as long as its body, is muscular and whip-like, dragging behind it as the creature moves.

## Presentation

Komodo Behemoths display coarse, warty scales across their entire body, with the scales along the back and tail forming rough ridges. Coloration varies from dark gray-green to nearly black, with lighter bands occasionally visible on younger specimens. Their eyes are positioned high on the head, providing excellent forward vision but limited peripheral sight. Their teeth are sharp, serrated, and constantly replaced throughout their lives—a new tooth will grow in if one is broken. The mouth opens vertically, allowing them to swallow prey nearly as large as themselves. A distinctive musky odor surrounds them at all times.

## Key Behaviors

Komodo Behemoths are solitary hunters that establish and fiercely defend large territories encompassing several square miles. They spend much of their day resting in burrows or dens, conserving energy until hungry or triggered by the presence of prey. When hunting, they employ patient ambush tactics, positioning themselves along known game trails and waiting motionlessly for hours or even days. Once prey appears within striking distance, they explode into action with shocking speed. Their saliva carries venom and a foulness that festers in any wound, making a bite a death sentence even if the initial wound is not immediately fatal. They will bite prey, then retreat to allow the venom and infection to weaken the animal before returning to feed.

## Combat Strategy

The Komodo Behemoth's primary strategy is ambush and patience. It positions itself for maximum advantage and strikes with overwhelming force before its opponent can react. If forced into extended combat with a living opponent, it relies on the poisonous, festering saliva in its bite to gradually incapacitate the enemy while it harries with tail strikes and claws. A behemoth will only pursue if the prey is wounded; if prey escapes unharmed, it generally abandons the chase, reserving energy for a more promising hunt.

## Attack Methods

### Powerful Bite

The behemoth lunges forward with jaw spread wide, aiming to clamp down on limbs or the throat; the bite carries venom and a foul infection in its saliva, and the wound worsens long after it is made.

### Tail Strike

With the force of a felled tree, the massive tail sweeps horizontally to knock opponents off their feet, destroy obstacles, or drive back multiple assailants; the tail can disarm, break bones, or crush.

## Special Abilities

### Infectious Bite

The Komodo Behemoth's bite is laden with venom and a festering infection; the wound itself is bad, and the poison and infection go on working, growing worse over time if untreated.

### Stealth Predator

Despite its enormous size, the behemoth moves with surprising stealth and silence when hunting, and it is very hard to spot before it strikes, particularly in rocky or vegetated terrain.
