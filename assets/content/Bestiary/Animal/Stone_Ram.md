# Appearance {#appearance}

![[stoneram|Stone Ram]]{float: top-left}

The creature stands upon stone as if born from it, its massive frame balanced with impossible confidence on a ledge that would offer most creatures only terror. The horns spiral upward from the skull, vast and dark as slate, each curve marked by deep grooves that speak of countless collisions with rivals and stone. The shaggy coat of gray and white wool ripples in wind, and the small hooves, improbably dainty for a creature of such bulk, click with perfect surety against stone. The eyes are watchful and intelligent, scanning not for immediate threat but assessing the terrain and nearby creatures with the confidence of something that cannot be caught on ground of its choosing.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Stone Ram is a powerful, heavily built mountain herbivore standing 4-5 feet at the shoulder and weighing 300-400 pounds, found on high-altitude cliffs, rocky plateaus, and mountainous regions across temperate and cool climates. These herd animals are superb climbers that maintain exclusive territories in terrain where ground-bound predators cannot follow. Adventurers encounter stone rams while traveling mountain passes, camping near cliffs, or hunting in areas where the rams establish grazing grounds.

## Presentation

The Stone Ram presents a compact, muscular form built for power and climbing capability. The body is stocky and heavily muscled, covered in thick, shaggy fur ranging from gray to gray-white with darker markings. The most distinctive feature is the spiraling horns that extend upward from the skull—enormous, dark, and deeply grooved from years of combat with rival rams and weathering against stone. The horns can exceed 3 feet in length and weigh 20+ pounds each. The head is broad and blocky, with a strong jaw adapted for grinding vegetation and a pair of forward-facing eyes. The legs are proportionally short but extraordinarily muscular and powerful. The hooves are small and highly specialized for gripping stone and rock, capable of finding purchase on surfaces that appear smooth to a human eye.

## Key Behaviors

Stone Rams live in herds ranging from 5 to 30 individuals, establishing exclusive territories on rocky high-altitude terrain. They are highly social within herds, with clear hierarchies established through headbutting contests. During the autumn rutting season, males become intensely aggressive and territorial. Stone Rams are active during dawn and dusk, spending hot midday periods resting in shade. They are primarily herbivorous, grazing on sparse alpine vegetation and browsing on bark and lichen. They are intelligent and capable of learning, remembering dangerous locations, hunters, and productive feeding grounds. The creatures are almost fearless within their mountain territory, where their climbing ability and rocky terrain provide complete dominance.

## Combat Strategy

A stone ram's primary response to threat is to use terrain advantage—the creature charges in directions that make pursuit difficult for less-capable climbers. If cornered, the ram becomes aggressive, using its horns and body weight to drive threats away. During rutting season, rams become much more aggressive and may charge at perceived rivals or threats without attempting escape. A charging ram uses its mass and momentum to knock opponents off balance or directly off cliff edges when possible.

## Attack Methods

### Horn Charge

The stone ram charges with all its weight and strength, using its spiraling horns to strike and gore opponents. The impact is sufficient to break bones in unarmored targets and to knock even armored opponents off balance. On cliff terrain, the ram aims to drive opponents toward edges.

### Rear and Kick

When rearing up, the stone ram uses its powerful hind legs to deliver upward kicks with small but hard hooves capable of inflicting serious wounds. This attack is used when the ram is cornered or defending young.

### Head Butt

The stone ram uses its thick skull as a battering weapon, delivering impacts that can daze and disorient opponents. This attack does less harm than the horned charge but can be repeated rapidly.

## Special Abilities

### Mountain Agility

The stone ram is supremely adapted to vertical and near-vertical terrain, capable of scaling near-vertical cliff faces and traversing ledges that would be impassable for humanoids. On rocky, steep, or uneven ground the creature has the upper hand entirely.

### Unyielding Charge

When charging downhill or across known terrain, the stone ram builds momentum that increases the impact force and likelihood of knocking opponents off balance. The creature's confidence in mountain terrain makes it nearly impossible to evade a downhill charge.

### Herd Coordination

Stone rams within herds coordinate defensive actions, using their numbers to present overwhelming threat or to execute pincer attacks against predators or threats.

### Exceptional Climbing

The stone ram's hooves are specialized for finding purchase on stone and rock. The creature can climb surfaces at angles that would be impossible for humanoids to attempt.

### Stubborn Determination

Once a stone ram commits to a charge or defense, it follows through with complete commitment and rarely retreats from a committed direction.

### Additional Information

Stone rams are most dangerous in their native mountain terrain where climbing ability and rocky environment give it complete mastery. In open ground or level terrain, much of that mastery is lost. Herds of stone rams are more dangerous than individuals, as coordination and numbers create overwhelming threat. Rams defending young become more aggressive but still rely first on terrain for defense. The creature's horns can be harvested after death and used for decoration, crafting, or magical use. Stone rams are traditionally hunted by mountain cultures, and hunting them is a significant rite of passage or religious practice.
