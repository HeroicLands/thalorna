# Appearance {#appearance}

![[sndstlkr|Sand Stalker]]{float: top-left}

Movement catches your eye — the ripple of a shadow across pale sand, gone as quickly as seen. The creature rises, and suddenly what was invisible becomes unmistakable: a lean, powerful feline silhouette against the desert heat. Its sandy-tan fur seems to shimmer and shift, making it difficult to focus upon even when you know where to look. The amber eyes fix on you with an unsettling intelligence, and you notice the tension in its body — every muscle coiled and ready. As it circles, its wide paws leave barely a trace in the sand, and you hear almost nothing despite its movement. The tail swishes once, twice, and you realize you're being assessed as potential prey.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Sand Stalker is a lithe desert feline predator reaching 6-7 feet in length with a shoulder height of 3-4 feet, found in arid badlands, dune fields, and rocky desert where small-to-medium prey animals are plentiful. These nocturnal hunters are stealthy specialists that hunt during cool night hours and rest during the day. Adventurers might encounter sand stalkers while traveling through deserts at night, disturbing the creature's rest, or crossing territory where the cat hunts.

## Presentation

The Sand Stalker presents a lean, muscular form built for speed and agility over brute strength. The fur is a light sandy-tan or pale golden color with subtle darker markings that provide extraordinary camouflage in desert environments. The body is lithe and compact, with long legs suited for extended movement across sand and rough terrain. The head is proportionally feline with large, forward-facing amber eyes suited for nocturnal hunting, pointed ears that swivel to track sound, and a sensitive nose adapted for scent-hunting in arid conditions. The paws are notably wide and padded, spreading weight across sand and leaving minimal traces of passage. The tail is long and muscular, used for balance and communication.

## Key Behaviors

Sand Stalkers are primarily nocturnal and are most active during cool evening and night hours, sheltering during daylight in caves, rocky crevices, or deep burrows. They are solitary and territorial, with each cat maintaining exclusive hunting grounds marked by scent deposits on prominent rocks and clawed markings. They hunt small mammals, lizards, birds, and other prey items suitable for a mid-sized predator, and they will opportunistically target larger prey including humanoids if encounter permits. Sand Stalkers are intelligent and capable of learning — a cat that has successfully hunted humanoids will recognize humans as prey in future encounters. They communicate through vocalizations, scent marking, and subtle body language.

## Combat Strategy

The sand stalker's primary tactic is to approach prey silently and from unexpected direction, using stealth and terrain to close distance before attacking. The initial attack is explosive — a pounce intended to knock the target off balance and create an opening for bites and claw attacks. If the initial strike fails or the engagement turns against the cat, the stalker will retreat into darkness or terrain advantage, circling to find a new opening. The cat prefers not to engage in prolonged combat with anything that can effectively defend itself, preferring to wait for weakness or further opportunities.

## Attack Methods

### Explosive Pounce

The sand stalker launches itself with explosive acceleration, using its full body weight to knock a target off balance. The attack combines momentum with claw rakes and biting, intended to overwhelm prey through surprise and ferocity.

### Raking Claw Attacks

Once engaged, the stalker uses its powerful forelimbs to rake and slash at exposed flesh, tearing clothing and creating wounds. The claws can penetrate leather and inflict serious bleeding wounds.

### Swift Bite

The sand stalker's bite is sharp and precise, targeted at exposed flesh, faces, hands, or the throat. The bite is used to establish dominance, open further wounds, or finish wounded prey.

## Special Abilities

### Desert Camouflage

The sand stalker's coloration is so effective in desert environments that it is nearly invisible when still or moving across sand and rocks. In the desert it is very hard to spot until it moves.

### Silent Prowl

The sand stalker's wide paws and light weight allow it to move almost silently, approaching prey without detection. It can move at speed without making a sound.

### Nocturnal Superiority

The sand stalker's eyes are adapted for night vision, allowing it to hunt effectively in near-total darkness. In the dark it sees and hunts far better than its prey.

### Scent Hunting

The sand stalker can track prey through smell, allowing it to hunt in darkness or when visual tracking is impossible. The cat can follow days-old scent trails and identify specific individuals by smell.

### Reflexive Evasion

The sand stalker's speed and agility allow it to dodge incoming attacks more effectively than most creatures, so that arrows and blows alike often miss it.

### Additional Information

Sand stalkers are most active during night hours and sleep or shelter during the day, making encounters during daylight hours rare. The cats avoid areas with significant human settlements or organized defense but will hunt isolated travelers or small groups. A stalker injured in combat will retreat and avoid re-engagement unless cornered or defending young. The creature's fur and claws are valuable to hunters and can be harvested to create armor or tools.
