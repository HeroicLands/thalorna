# Appearance {#appearance}

![[roc|Roc]]{float: top-left}

The shadow falls first – a darkness that swallows the sun, impossibly vast, and you realize too late what it means. The sound arrives moments after, a shriek that seems to split the sky itself, a cry of hunger and territorial claim that makes your bones vibrate. Then you see it: a creature so enormous the eye struggles to contain it, wings spanning hundreds of feet, their undersides catching light in patterns of bronze and gold that seem to shift with each stroke. The talons are visible even at this distance – curved, dark, each one the size of a man's leg. The beak, hooked and cruel, opens as the creature circles, and you understand with perfect clarity that you are being assessed as a meal.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Roc is an impossibly massive bird of prey, with a wingspan exceeding 100 feet and a body weight measured in tons, representing the apex of avian predation across isolated mountains, deep valleys, and remote coastlines. These creatures nest on inaccessible peaks and hunt creatures as large as elephants, making them living disasters for unwary expeditions. Adventurers encounter rocs only in the most remote and dangerous wilderness, where the creature's territory prevents all but the most desperate or foolish from passing.

## Presentation

The Roc is a creature of overwhelming scale and predatory majesty. The body is covered in feathers that range from dark brown to golden-bronze, often with fine patterning that aids in camouflage across rocky terrain when the bird is at rest. The wings are proportionally huge, muscular, and capable of generating the lift necessary to carry a fully loaded merchant wagon airborne. The head is fearsome – a massive skull housing an intelligent brain, with forward-facing eyes set for binocular vision, and a hooked beak large enough to shear off a tree limb or pierce armor. The talons are as thick as a man's arm and equipped with curved claws the length of swords. The legs are muscular and thick, built to grip and support the creature's tremendous weight.

## Key Behaviors

Rocs are solitary and fiercely territorial, with individual birds maintaining hunting ranges that can span hundreds of square miles. A roc hunts by soaring at tremendous altitudes, using its extraordinary vision to locate prey at distances that would be impossible for humans to match. Once prey is identified, the roc stoops in a powered dive that reaches speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, using gravity and muscle power to deliver devastating impact. Rocs are intelligent and capable of learning, remembering locations where game is plentiful and hunters who pose threats. Mating occurs only once every few years, and a nesting roc becomes nearly homicidal in its protectiveness of eggs and young. The creature must eat enormous quantities of meat daily and will hunt continuously during daylight hours.

## Combat Strategy

The roc's dominance in the air is absolute, and it uses that advantage ruthlessly. It attacks from altitude, diving with overwhelming speed and force, attempting to seize prey with its talons and lift them skyward where it can finish them at leisure or carry them to its nest. If forced to land or engage on the ground, the roc becomes somewhat less dominant but remains extraordinarily dangerous. It uses its beak and talons with devastating effect, and its size advantage means it can easily overpower anything short of a much larger creature or a group of well-organized opponents. The roc will never retreat unless mortally wounded – its size and dominance mean it has no natural predators and no experience with defeat.

## Attack Methods

### Diving Talon Strike

The roc folds its wings and dives from altitude, building speed until the impact alone would shatter bone. The talons, extended at the last moment, rake across targets, penetrating armor and inflicting terrible wounds. A successful strike can seize a humanoid-sized target and carry it aloft.

### Crushing Grip

If the roc has seized a victim with its talons, it crushes with the full force of its leg muscles, capable of breaking ribs, collapsing lungs, and shattering limbs. A creature caught in this grip struggles to maintain consciousness.

### Beak Strike

Using its massive hooked beak like a titanic curved sword, the roc slashes and pierces at targets. The beak can tear through armor, sever limbs, or create terrible wounds in unprotected flesh.

### Crushing Impact

The roc's body weight, diverted downward in a diving attack, can impact targets with force equivalent to a falling building. Even if the talons miss, the impact alone can inflict serious injury.

## Special Abilities

### Aerial Mastery

The roc is supremely powerful in flight, capable of hovering, diving, climbing, and maneuvering with grace that belies its massive size.

### Immense Strength

A creature with a body weight measured in tons possesses strength far beyond any land-bound predator. The roc can lift and carry creatures weighing up to a ton or more, carry building-sized objects, and deliver impacts that register on a scale with small earthquakes.

### Predatory Vision

The roc's eyesight is extraordinarily acute, allowing it to spot movement from altitudes of thousands of feet and to track prey across vast distances. The bird can hunt in conditions where humans would be completely blind.

### Impenetrable Plumage

The roc's feathers are dense, overlapping, and incredibly tough – they protect it like armor against most conventional weapons and shelter it from weather in any condition.

### Regenerative Capability

While not magical, the roc's body heals fast, allowing it to recover from wounds that would permanently disable other creatures.

### Additional Information

Rocs are rare enough that many take them for myth. The presence of a roc in a region effectively closes that territory to normal settlement and trade – the loss of livestock and people becomes unsustainable. Rocs can live for centuries and create strong impressions of themselves in local culture and folklore. A roc keeps the large prey animals of a vast territory in check.
