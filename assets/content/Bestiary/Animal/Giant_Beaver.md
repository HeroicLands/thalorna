# Appearance {#appearance}

![[gntbvr|Giant Beaver]]{float: top-left}

The sound reaches you first—the rhythmic crack and splinter of a tree trunk being systematically gnawed. You push through the brush and find yourself staring at a creature the size of a pony, its fur dark and slick with water, its massive teeth clearly visible as it works the wood with mechanical precision. The thing does not look up, focused entirely on its labor—but you feel the weight of its attention nonetheless. Around its territory, you notice the scope of its engineering: trees felled in geometric perfection, their trunks stripped and woven into a massive dam that has entirely reshaped the river. The water level has risen dramatically, drowning the forest and creating a landscape of flooded timber and still, dark water. When the beaver finally turns to look at you, its tail—a massive, paddle-like weapon—rises and slaps the water with a thunderous crack that sends spray to your chest.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Giant Beaver is an intelligent, industrious creature standing four feet at the shoulder and weighing several hundred pounds. These are master engineers that fundamentally reshape their environment, constructing elaborate dam systems and lodge structures that entirely redirect watercourses and create new landscapes. A giant beaver's territory is instantly recognizable by its engineering—lakes that did not exist before, waterways redirected, forests partially drowned. These creatures are territorial and aggressive in defense of their domain, particularly during construction seasons. Adventurers most commonly encounter them while traveling through beaver-infested waterways or when they attempt to cross a dam that blocks their passage.

## Presentation

The Giant Beaver is a powerful aquatic mammal with a body built for both water and land. Its fur is dense and waterproof, typically dark brown with hints of red or lighter undertones, and it sits wet and slick whether the creature is in or out of water. The shoulders and hindquarters are powerfully muscled, and the hind feet are partially webbed, providing propulsion in water. The front paws are smaller and more dexterous, equipped with sharp claws used for felling trees and manipulating materials. The tail is the creature's most distinctive feature—a flat, paddle-like appendage covered in scales and nearly as long as the body, used for balance, signaling, and as a powerful weapon. The head is blocky and powerful, with prominent incisors that never stop growing and are kept sharp by constant gnawing. The eyes are small and set to the sides of the head, providing good peripheral vision. The overall impression is of a creature designed for a specific purpose—water, wood, and creation.

## Key Behaviors

Giant Beavers are highly intelligent and work with singular focus on constructing and maintaining their territories. A territory includes elaborate dam systems (sometimes consisting of multiple dams on a single watercourse), lodge structures that are homes and defensible positions, and carefully maintained foraging areas. Beavers spend much of the day gathering wood and materials, felling trees with their teeth and transporting the material through water or by dragging. They are social within family units but fiercely territorial toward other beavers. They are primarily nocturnal but will work during daylight hours if urgent construction demands it. A beaver that perceives a threat to its dam or lodge responds with immediate, focused aggression.

## Combat Strategy

A Giant Beaver defends its territory with absolute commitment. When threatened, it typically retreats to water where it has supreme advantage, then attacks from there—using the water as both weapon and escape route. In direct combat, the beaver uses its powerful tail as a crushing weapon and its bite for grappling and damage. The creature fights methodically and without hesitation, showing no fear of larger opponents and no inclination to flee once combat has begun. A beaver defending its dam will draw attackers into complex terrain of water, flooded timber, and narrow passages where its knowledge provides advantage.

## Attack Methods

### Powerful Bite

The beaver's incisors are capable of cutting through wood and are equally effective against flesh and bone. A beaver clamps onto a target and holds, attempting to drag the target into water or closer to the beaver's body for additional attacks.

### Tail Slam

The flat, powerful tail is brought to bear as a bludgeoning weapon—the beaver swings or brings it down with force sufficient to break bones, knock creatures off balance, or drive them into water. The tail can also be used to slap the water, creating waves or splashes that obscure vision.

## Special Abilities

### Aquatic Master

In water, the Giant Beaver is supremely graceful and fast—it can navigate submerged passages, hold its breath for extended periods, and move at speeds that land creatures cannot match. On land, the beaver is slower and more vulnerable. In its own territory with its dam and dam-adjacent waters, the beaver gains significant tactical advantage.

### Tireless Engineering

The beaver can fell trees and move materials at great speed, reshaping waterways and constructing barriers. This ability is useful for trapping or isolating enemies within the beaver's territory.

## Additional Information

A beaver's territory can be extremely valuable—a well-constructed dam provides water power for mills, the lake behind the dam provides resources, and the flooded timber can be harvested. Negotiating with a giant beaver for access to its territory is theoretically possible but practically difficult—the creatures are not interested in non-wood-related payment. A dead beaver's tail is prized for various purposes including cloaks and trophies. The teeth are sometimes worked into decorative items or tools.
