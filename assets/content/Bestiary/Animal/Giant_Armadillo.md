# Appearance {#appearance}

![[gntarmdl|Giant Armadillo]]{float: top-left}

The earth itself seems to rise before you, a hillside of mud and moss resolving into the armored mass of a creature easily twelve feet from snout to tail. It moves with the inexorable slowness of something that has never needed to hurry, each massive claw sinking deep into the soft earth beneath it. The shell that covers its back gleams dully in the light—layer upon layer of segmented armor the color of river stone and old bone. As it turns its head toward you, you see the little eyes, sharp and shrewd, studying you with the calculating gaze of something unimpressed by your size or presence. The smell hits next: rich loam and a musky, acidic reek of specialized digestion.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Giant Armadillo is a massive, solitary mammal that can exceed twelve feet in length and weigh as much as a small pony. Encased in segmented bony plates, these creatures are living fortifications that lumber through their territories with minimal regard for other inhabitants. These are nocturnal burrowers that command vast underground warren systems and aggressively defend them from intrusion. Adventurers most commonly encounter them when exploring underground or accidentally camping in territory the creature considers its own.

## Presentation

The Giant Armadillo is a squat, heavily-built creature with a body that seems all muscle and armor. The dorsal surface is covered in overlapping segments of bone and keratin that form a natural shell—dull gray or brown in color, often caked with mud and insect secretions. The ventral surface (belly) is naked skin with sparse hair, vulnerable compared to the back. The head is small relative to the body and ends in a long, tapered snout with a small mouth adapted for eating insects and grubs. The eyes are small and set high, providing limited vision but adequate smell and hearing. The legs are short, thick, and powerful, ending in massive claws up to a foot long—tools designed for excavation and defense. The tail is long and tapered, sometimes used as a burrowing tool. The overall impression is one of ancient, overwhelming bulk.

## Key Behaviors

Giant Armadillos are solitary creatures that spend much of their life below ground in elaborate burrow systems that can extend for hundreds of feet. These burrows are not random tunnels but carefully engineered dwellings with multiple exits, chambers for sleeping, and designated feeding areas. A giant armadillo maintains this territory with fierce dedication, marking boundaries through scent and aggressively driving away intruders. They are primarily nocturnal, leaving their burrows in darkness to forage for insects, grubs, and vegetable matter. During daylight hours, they remain underground where they are safest. They are methodical, patient creatures that show no fear of smaller creatures and move at their own deliberate pace, as if time itself bends around them.

## Combat Strategy

A Giant Armadillo is not a creature that fights for dominance—it is a creature that simply endures. When threatened, its primary strategy is to curl into a nearly impenetrable ball, with the armored dorsum facing all directions and the vulnerable underside protected. From this position, it can remain indefinitely, waiting for threats to pass. If driven from its burrow or forced to move, it will lumber toward safety with singular focus, ignoring most attacks and using its powerful frame to crush or bulldoze through obstacles. Only if it cannot reach its burrow will it uncurl and fight with claws and head-butts, and this is rare—a giant armadillo's temperament is defensive, not aggressive.

## Attack Methods

### Talon Slash

The massive claws are the armadillo's only serious weapons—drawn in powerful raking attacks that can disembowel or cripple a target. These attacks are slow and telegraphed but carry tremendous force behind them.

### Armored Ram

The armadillo will use its armored head and body mass as a weapon, lowering its head and charging into obstacles or opponents. The impact can knock smaller creatures down or cripple them if they are caught beneath the animal's weight.

## Special Abilities

### Segmented Armor

The overlapping plates of bone and keratin provide heavy protection against slashing, piercing, and even blunt weapons. The segments distribute force across the creature's body, reducing damage from individual strikes. The belly and underside are unarmored and vulnerable.

### Defensive Curl

When the armadillo coils into a ball, it becomes nearly impervious—attacks from the sides, back, or above are deflected harmlessly, and only attacks from the underside (which is inaccessible when curled) can cause real damage. An armadillo in this position cannot attack but is patient and will remain curled until threats depart.

### Master Burrower

The giant armadillo can excavate through soil and soft rock at surprising speed, creating new burrows or enlarging existing passages. It can disappear underground in minutes, and following it into its burrows is a risky proposition.

## Additional Information

Giant Armadillo burrows are sometimes claimed and enlarged by other creatures, becoming de facto cave systems. A giant armadillo's shell, when shed (which occurs naturally), can be worked into impressive armor or decorative pieces. Anyone who finds a burrow system should exercise caution, as the armadillo is territorial and will defend its territory relentlessly.
