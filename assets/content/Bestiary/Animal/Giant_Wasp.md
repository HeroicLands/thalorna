# Appearance {#appearance}

![[gntwsp|Giant Wasp]]{float: top-left}

The buzzing starts as a distant drone that grows steadily louder, filling the air with a sound that makes your teeth ache. Then it appears: a creature the size of a large dog, striped in vivid black and yellow in a pattern that screams warning. The wings beat in a blur of motion that seems physically impossible, generating a hum that vibrates in your chest. The body is sleek and predatory, segmented and armored, and the stinger—wickedly barbed, dripping with clear venom—extends downward like a curved sword. The mandibles click and snap, and the creature's rapid, erratic flight patterns make it nearly impossible to track. You have the sudden, primal conviction that you are a direct threat to something that will not hesitate to respond with absolute violence.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Giant Wasp is a vicious aerial predator that combines speed, agility, and a devastating sting. Unlike bees, wasps are purely carnivorous hunters and show no hesitation or mercy in pursuit of prey. These creatures are territorial and aggressive, establishing large colonies that can number in the dozens or hundreds. A disturbed wasp colony represents a threat that can devastate settlements or hunting parties. Adventurers most commonly encounter them when traveling through forested or mountainous areas where hives are established, or when they accidentally disturb a nest.

## Presentation

The Giant Wasp is a sleek, aggressive predator built entirely for aerial combat and rapid hunting. The body is composed of three distinct segments: head, thorax, and abdomen, all covered in chitinous armor in vivid black and yellow striping, a warning coloration. The head bears large, compound eyes providing excellent vision, and powerful mandibles designed for cutting and slicing. The thorax is muscular and supports two pairs of wings that beat rapidly enough to produce an audible hum. The abdomen is elongated and ends in a long, barbed stinger that curves downward, dripping with clear venom. The legs are relatively short but equipped with claws for gripping. The overall impression is of barely contained aggression and predatory competence.

## Key Behaviors

Giant Wasps are solitary hunters and apex predators, but they often operate from a central hive where the queen resides. They are diurnal and most active during daylight hours when prey is abundant. A hunting wasp patrols its territory continuously, searching for flying insects, small birds, or other prey. Upon finding prey, the wasp attacks with shocking violence and speed. If prey is too large to carry back to the hive, the wasp still attacks viciously, apparently out of pure territorial aggression. A wasp near its hive is far more aggressive and will pursue intruders relentlessly, and if a hive is threatened, dozens of wasps emerge simultaneously to defend it.

## Combat Strategy

A Giant Wasp's preferred method is the high-speed diving strike—approaching from above or behind and striking with the full force of aerial momentum. The wasp delivers a sting that injects venom and causes pain while allowing the wasp to retreat before the target can fully react. If the target is incapacitated or captured, the wasp may land and use mandibles for cutting. A lone wasp retreats after a single failed strike, but multiple wasps attack repeatedly, working to separate targets and concentrate their attacks on individuals. A wasp defending its hive shows no instinct to retreat and will make suicidal attacks to protect the colony.

## Attack Methods

### Stinger Strike

A rapid thrust with the barbed stinger, injecting venom designed to cause pain, disorientation, and a spreading paralysis. Multiple stings compound the venom's effect.

### Mandible Slash

Once prey is immobilized or grappled, the wasp uses sharp mandibles to deliver quick, cutting strikes. These attacks can slice through soft tissue and light armor.

## Special Abilities

### Aerial Superiority

In open air, the Giant Wasp has absolute tactical advantage—it can dive at speeds that land-bound creatures cannot match, can climb vertically with ease, and can reverse direction with a precision that allows it to evade almost any ground-based attack. Enclosed or confined spaces reduce this advantage significantly.

### Rapid Dive Attack

When the wasp has altitude and space to build speed, its dive becomes devastating—the initial stinger strike delivers maximum force and venom. A diving wasp is nearly impossible to dodge for creatures with limited mobility.

## Additional Information

A Giant Wasp's venom is valuable to alchemists and poisoners—harvesting it is extraordinarily dangerous. A wasp's stinger is sometimes worked into weaponry. Wasp hives can occasionally be negotiated with or manipulated, but such attempts are risky and unpredictable. Fire is effective against wasp colonies—burning a hive destroys it and causes the wasps to flee.
