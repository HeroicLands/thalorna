# Appearance {#appearance}

![[thrnbckb|Thornback Boar]]{float: top-left}

The sound comes first: a furious snort that seems to explode from the undergrowth, followed by the savage crashing of something massive pushing through brush. The creature that emerges is pure, concentrated malevolence—a stocky form covered in coarse bristles, with jagged, bony spines protruding from its back like a warrior’s armor made of bone and fury. The tusks curve upward and forward, aged and stained dark, clearly used repeatedly to gore enemies into submission. The eyes are small, deep-set, and burning with an intensity that seems personal, as if this creature has decided you are a direct affront to its existence.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Thornback Boar is a wild, heavily built predator standing 4-5 feet at the shoulder and weighing 300-400 pounds, found in forests, scrublands, and rough terrain throughout temperate regions. These ferociously territorial creatures are dangerous to anything that ventures into claimed space, and the solitary males are the most aggressive of all. Adventurers encounter thornback boars while traveling forests, hunting game, or inadvertently entering territory claimed by the creatures.

## Presentation

The Thornback Boar is a compact, muscular creature built for charging and goring rather than running or climbing. The body is covered in coarse, bristly hair ranging from dark brown to black, often matted and stained with mud, blood, and vegetation. The most distinctive feature is the row of jagged, bony spines running down the back from neck to tail—each spike 4-8 inches in length, sharp at the point, and plainly a defense against attacking predators. The head is massive and blocky, with small, deep-set eyes that burn with primal intensity, and a snout adapted for rooting in earth. The tusks are curved, thick, and often darkened with age and use, capable of perforating armor and inflicting terrible wounds. The legs are powerful and short, built for driving forward with all the creature’s weight.

## Key Behaviors

Thornback Boars are territorial and aggressively defensive of claimed ranges, which include sources of water, good rooting ground, and shelter. They are primarily solitary except during mating season, when males’ aggression peaks. They spend much of their time rooting through soil and undergrowth for food, leaving trails of disturbed earth and churned vegetation. Mothers defending young become nearly uncontrollable in aggression. The creatures are most active during dawn, dusk, and night, resting during midday heat. They are clever in defending territory and in learning, and a boar that has successfully driven off predators learns to recognize threats and reuse successful tactics.

## Combat Strategy

The thornback boar charges directly at threats with single-minded determination, attempting to gore with tusks and trample with all its weight. Once engaged, it continues attacking with complete commitment, ignoring injuries and pain. The boar uses the spines on its back as natural defense against attacks from behind or from above. A cornered boar fights to the death rather than retreating. Boars defending young or territory become absolutely unstoppable, fighting with suicidal determination.

## Attack Methods

### Goring Charge

The thornback boar charges forward with all its weight concentrated behind its tusks, attempting to gore and disembowel opponents. The attack is devastatingly powerful and capable of launching even armored opponents backward.

### Trampling Stomp

Once a target is knocked off balance, the boar may attempt to simply trample the victim under its weight, causing crushing injuries and hoof wounds.

### Spine Damage

Anyone attacking from behind or attempting to grapple the boar’s rear risks injury from the jagged spines, which can inflict lacerations and puncture wounds.

## Special Abilities

### Armor Spines

The jagged spines along the boar’s back protect it against slashing blows and are a hazard to anything attempting to grapple or attack from behind.

### Relentless Charge

Once the boar commits to a charge, it is nearly unstoppable, continuing forward through most obstacles and continuing to attack even when severely injured.

### Territorial Aggression

Within claimed territory, the boar fights with enhanced aggression and strikes with greater accuracy, drawing confidence from dominance in familiar ground.

### Rage Frenzy

As the boar becomes injured, it becomes progressively more aggressive and dangerous, not backing down or retreating regardless of its wounds.

### Additional Information

Thornback boars are most dangerous in forests and rough terrain where their charging capability is less restricted. In open ground, the boar’s advantage is somewhat reduced. Mothers defending young are nearly unbeatable and should be avoided entirely. A boar that has successfully fought off predators learns to recognize and be more aggressive toward future threats. The creature’s tusks and spines can be harvested after death for weapon-making or crafting. Boar hunting is a traditional activity in many cultures and carries significant cultural weight and danger.
