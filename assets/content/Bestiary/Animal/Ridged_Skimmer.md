# Appearance {#appearance}

![[rdgdskmm|Ridged Skimmer]]{float: top-left}

The water erupts with wrongness—a sinuous neck rising from dark depths, scales sliding across each other with a wet, sliding sound. The thing’s eyes emerge first, unblinking and alien, then the elongated snout with teeth like needle points revealed as the mouth opens. The creature moves with predatory grace that seems at odds with its emergence from murky water, and the sound that rumbles from its chest is something between a crocodile’s hiss and a creature gargling blood. The water around it seems to chill, and you instinctively understand that you have just been assessed as either threat or prey.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Ridged Skimmer is a semi-aquatic predator measuring 6-8 feet in length plus an equally long tail, found in rivers, lakes, and coastal shallows across warm and temperate regions. These creatures are ambush specialists that spend most of their time submerged, using patience and predatory instinct to strike at unsuspecting prey. Adventurers might encounter skimmers while traveling along rivers, crossing bodies of water, or camping near aquatic environments where the creature hunts.

## Presentation

The Ridged Skimmer presents a sleek, streamlined form built for aquatic hunting. The body is covered in smooth, dark green scales with subtle patterning that provides camouflage in murky water. The neck is elongated and flexible, allowing the creature to reach and strike from unexpected angles. The head is proportionally large with unblinking, vertically-pupiled eyes positioned on the sides for monocular vision, a long snout filled with dozens of backward-pointing teeth designed to grip slippery prey, and flared nostrils positioned at the snout’s tip to allow breathing while mostly submerged. A thin crest runs along the neck and back, likely used for display or additional aquatic maneuvering. The tail is long, muscular, and whip-like, capable of lashing with significant force. The legs are short and positioned laterally, with webbed feet and sharp claws for gripping rocks and roots.

## Key Behaviors

Ridged Skimmers are ambush predators par excellence, spending hours or entire days nearly motionless in water, with only their eyes above the surface, waiting for suitable prey. They are solitary and territorial, with individual skimmers maintaining specific hunting grounds and attacking rivals that intrude. The creatures are most active during dawn and dusk, when light conditions favor their hunting strategy. They are capable of producing low, bubbling vocalizations that seem to echo unnaturally through water, possibly serving as territorial warnings or hunting coordination signals. Skimmers are gluttons and will consume multiple prey items in a single feeding, often caching extra food in underwater crevices or beneath submerged logs.

## Combat Strategy

The skimmer’s primary tactic is to remain submerged and invisible until prey approaches within striking distance, then attack with explosive force, attempting to drag the victim into water where the skimmer’s advantage becomes overwhelming. On land, if forced into combat, the skimmer becomes frenzied and aggressive, using its powerful tail to strike and its neck to lash and snap at opponents. The creature is capable of moving surprisingly quickly on land for short distances but tires rapidly if unable to return to water. The skimmer will always attempt to retreat to deeper water if the fight turns against it, knowing that in its aquatic domain it is vastly superior.

## Attack Methods

### Submerged Strike and Drag

From below the water’s surface, the skimmer lunges upward and forward with all its strength, attempting to clamp its jaws around a limb, torso, or head of a prey item. Once contact is established, it immediately attempts to pull its victim back into deep water, using water resistance and the prey’s buoyancy to assist the grapple. The needle-like teeth create puncture wounds that bleed freely.

### Neck Lash and Snap

The skimmer uses its flexible neck and elongated head to snap at targets with speed and precision. The bite is effective at close range and can be directed from unexpected angles due to the creature’s flexibility.

### Tail Whip

The powerful tail swings in a wide arc, creating a weapon capable of hitting targets on land or in water. The tail lash can knock opponents off balance, create distance, or deliver a striking blow with considerable force.

## Special Abilities

### Aquatic Ambush

The skimmer’s entire body and hunting strategy are built for submerged waiting and sudden attacks. When striking from a submerged or hidden position, the creature strikes harder and more surely.

### Drowning Grip

Once the skimmer has established a grapple, it is very difficult to escape. The creature’s strong jaws and body control make it nearly impossible to break free without significant strength advantage or magical assistance. The skimmer can drag a grappled victim underwater and hold them there, forcing them to hold their breath.

### Aquatic Mastery

The skimmer moves through water with perfect grace and control, capable of achieving speeds that exceed human swimming and maneuvering in ways that defy easy prediction. In water, the skimmer is far superior to land-bound opponents.

### Predatory Patience

The skimmer can remain motionless for extended periods without apparent discomfort or frustration. It will wait for hours or even days for suitable prey, never breaking concentration or seeking alternative activity.

### Additional Information

Skimmers are territorial and will attack boats, waders, and large animals that encroach on their hunting grounds. They prefer fish and waterfowl but will take larger prey if opportunity presents. A skimmer that has successfully hunted humanoids may become increasingly bold and dangerous to future travelers. The creatures are most dangerous during breeding season when they become even more aggressive and territorial. Skimmers can be deterred by noise and vibration but attracted by blood in the water.
