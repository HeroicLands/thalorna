# Appearance {#appearance}

![[clffstlk|Cliff Stalker]]{float: top-left}

The rock face is pale gray and mottled patches until suddenly it isn't stone at all – the shape resolves into a colossal predator resting on a ledge fifty feet above. Its pale coat, spotted with dark rosettes, is so perfectly matched to the stone that it seems less like camouflage and more like the creature is made of rock itself. The moment it catches your scent, its ears rotate forward, and long amber eyes fix directly on you with singular purpose. The tail, extraordinarily long, begins to move in slow arcs, almost hypnotic – this is not a creature scanning for food. This is a hunter that has already decided.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Cliff Stalker is an apex predator of high mountain terrain: a massive feline built for vertical terrain and precision ambush. Standing three feet tall at the shoulder and measuring up to seven feet in length including its long tail, these solitary hunters are significantly larger than snow leopards while retaining the mountainous habitat. They are extraordinarily patient predators, capable of stalking prey for hours or days, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. A Cliff Stalker is a creature of calculation – every movement is deliberate, every attack rehearsed mentally before execution. These creatures view humans as prey rather than threats, and they have learned that human travelers carry food and are generally less capable of defending themselves than mountain goats or rams. Adventurers traversing mountain passes, exploring high-altitude ruins, or camping in alpine terrain may become prey without ever knowing a predator watches from the rocks above.

## Presentation

A powerfully built feline with the frame of a lion scaled for mountain terrain. The body is compact and muscular, with very powerful hindquarters and shoulders. The head is proportionally smaller than a lion's, with high-set eyes positioned forward for binocular vision. The ears are small and rounded, capable of independent rotation. The coat is thick and luxuriously soft, pale gray or silvery in base color, marked with dark rosettes or spots that provide perfect camouflage against rock and stone. The paws are unusually large with prominent calluses on the paw pads, adapted for gripping stone even when wet or icy. The claws are sharp and slightly curved. The tail is extraordinarily long – often longer than the body – and muscular, used extensively for balance on narrow surfaces. Scars marking successful predation or intra-species conflicts are common, particularly around the face and shoulders. The overall impression is of a creature perfectly matched to its environment, almost indistinguishable from the terrain until movement betrays its presence.

## Key Behaviors

Cliff Stalkers are strictly solitary, with each individual claiming and defending a territory spanning ten to thirty square miles of mountainous terrain. They are territorial toward other Cliff Stalkers and will patrol boundaries, mark with scent, and fight rivals to maintain control. They hunt alone by preference and only tolerate proximity to other Cliff Stalkers during mating season. Their prey is typically mountain goats, ibex, or other high-altitude ungulates, which they hunt through patient stalking. A typical hunt involves identifying prey, tracking it for hours or days, getting into position above the prey, and then striking from above with explosive violence. They can remain perfectly motionless for hours, controlling breathing and heartbeat to minimize vibration and scent dispersal. Between kills, they rest extensively, sleeping much of the day and hunting primarily during hours when prey is most active. They have learned to recognize human settlements and livestock, and a Cliff Stalker that has successfully killed humans or domestic animals will repeat the behavior. They have poor tolerance for cold and prefer to hunt in warmer months, retiring to high caves during winter.

## Combat Strategy

A Cliff Stalker's ideal strategy is ambush from above. The creature positions itself above a travel route or camp, waits for prey to settle or become distracted, then attacks with explosive force from above. The goal is to pin the prey, control its head and neck, and deliver a bite to the spine or throat that causes rapid death. Against multiple opponents, the Cliff Stalker prefers to target the weakest or most isolated individual, attempting to drag them away from the group and kill them in isolation. If an attack fails or the Cliff Stalker is injured, it will retreat to high ground where it is difficult to pursue and can observe from relative safety. The creature is intelligent enough to learn defensive patterns and will avoid repeating failed tactics. Once it has wounded prey, it will follow at distance, waiting for exhaustion to make the prey vulnerable. A Cliff Stalker will fight if cornered or defending a kill, but such combat is a last resort.

## Attack Methods

### Pouncing Ambush

The Cliff Stalker launches from a position above or behind, attempting to knock the target down and control movement. The impact, combined with the creature's weight, is often sufficient to incapacitate human-sized targets immediately. The creature attempts to drive the target to the ground face-first, compromising ability to defend.

### Throat Bite

Once prey is pinned, the Cliff Stalker attempts to deliver a killing bite to the throat, severing arteries and causing death through blood loss within minutes. The jaw strength is sufficient to crush the larynx and cervical spine. A successful bite to the throat is typically fatal.

### Spine Bite

If the prey is down, the Cliff Stalker will bite the spinal column, attempting to paralyze the target through spinal cord damage. A successfully targeted spine bite paralyzes the hindquarters or lower body, rendering escape impossible.

### Raking with Claws

When fighting from a position other than on top of prey, the Cliff Stalker uses its claws to rake, attempting to open wounds that bleed freely. Multiple rake attacks to the same area can sever tendons and cause loss of limb function.

## Special Abilities

### Superlative Ambush Predator

The Cliff Stalker is made for ambush: patience, camouflage, accuracy, and explosive violence. An attack from ambush is usually decisive – targets are often incapacitated by impact before they can mount defense. The creature's patience is limitless; it will stalk prey for days if necessary, waiting for the perfect opportunity. Its ability to remain completely motionless for extended periods makes detection extraordinarily difficult.

### Surefooted on Vertical Terrain

The Cliff Stalker moves on nearly vertical rock faces with the same confidence humans have on level ground. Its wide paws and pad structure provide extraordinary grip even on smooth, slick, or icy stone. The creature is nearly impossible to knock off balance or cause to fall, even when forced to fight on terrain that would be deadly for humans.

### Exceptional Vision and Hearing

Despite preferring ambush, the Cliff Stalker's senses are extraordinarily acute. It can see prey from considerable distances, identify movement at extreme range, and hear sounds that human ears cannot perceive. This sensory advantage makes its hunting sure and allows the creature to detect threats before they become dangerous.

### Extreme Pain Tolerance and Killer Instinct

A Cliff Stalker that has committed to an attack will complete it regardless of injury or resistance. Pain does not cause retreat or hesitation. Injured Cliff Stalkers become more aggressive, not less. This combination of pain tolerance and killer instinct makes them extraordinarily dangerous even when fighting a superior force.
