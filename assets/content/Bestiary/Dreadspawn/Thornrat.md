# Appearance {#appearance}

![[thornrat|Thornrat]]{float: top-left}

A shape no larger than a cat skitters across the underbrush, and in the shadows you catch a glimpse of something wrong – a creature bristling with needle-like spines that cover its entire body like a grotesque suit of armor. Its fur, matted and diseased, hangs in clumps between the spines, and the stench that radiates from it is nauseating – a smell of rot and poison and festering wounds. Its eyes glow with a sickly green luminescence, and as it catches your scent, it hisses, revealing fangs that seem impossibly large for such a small creature and dripping with venom that glows faintly in the darkness. Then, in a blur of motion, the creature launches itself upward, and spines shower outward like a gauntlet of needles aimed directly at you, each one leaving a trail of toxic miasma in the air.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Thornrats are plague-bearers and scavengers of corruption, creatures that seem to grow in numbers wherever filth and disease congregate. They are technically small – barely larger than a normal rat – but they punch far beyond their weight through venomous spines, toxic bites, and their uncanny ability to spread sickness and infection. A Thornrat colony can bring disease and death to an entire settlement if left unchecked, and some villages live in perpetual fear of their arrival. They are drawn to rot and decay, nesting in dungheaps, graves, and plague-houses, and they seem to carry numerous diseases. One theory holds that Thornrats are manifestations of disease itself rather than natural creatures, given flesh and hunger by concentrations of corruption.

## Presentation

A Thornrat stands roughly 8 to 12 inches in height, with a body resembling a rat or mongoose crossed with a porcupine – muscular and lithe beneath a covering of barbed, poisonous spines. Its fur is mangy and diseased, falling out in patches to reveal skin that is sickly gray or mottled purple-black. The spines covering it are the color of old bone or diseased ivory, arranged in overlapping rows, and they seem to continuously regenerate – removed spines quickly grow back. Its head is vaguely rat-like, with whiskers of questionable origin and eyes that glow a sickly green with faint bioluminescence. Its mouth contains fangs of surprising size and sharpness, and they drip constantly with venom that glows faintly. The creature emits a constant, nauseating odor of decay and poison, and anything it touches becomes tainted with a slick, sickly fluid that stains and burns.

## Key Behaviors

Thornrats are communal creatures that form colonies, often ranging from a dozen to hundreds of individuals in an infested area. They are nocturnal hunters that seem drawn to filth, decay, and disease. They will nest in dungheaps, grave-earth, sewers, and anywhere that death concentrates. The creatures show a surprising level of coordination for animals of their size – they will work together to coordinate attacks or to herd prey toward better kill-zones. They breed rapidly, and a Thornrat colony can grow out of all control if left unchecked. The presence of a Thornrat colony seems to accelerate disease and decay in an area, as though their very presence poisons the environment.

## Combat Strategy

A single Thornrat is a minor threat, but they are virtually never encountered alone. They attack through a combination of ranged spine projectiles and quick, darting melee strikes with their venomous fangs. The creatures are skittish and will attempt to flee if significantly threatened, but in groups they gain courage and will swarm prey. They coordinate their attacks, launching volleys of spines simultaneously to overwhelm targets, and they use cover and terrain to their advantage. They are fast enough that cornering one requires significant effort, and they will attempt to lead pursuers into areas where other colony members can ambush.

## Attack Methods

### Barbed Spine Salvo

The Thornrat contracts its entire body, launching dozens of razor-sharp, poisonous spines outward in all directions. Targets caught by the barrage suffer multiple shallow wounds and are exposed to the creature's toxins.

### Venomous Bite and Slash

The creature darts in close, attempting to bite or rake with its fangs and tiny claws. While the damage is minor, the venom injected is potent, and the wounds tend to become infected and inflamed.

## Special Abilities

### Spine Regeneration

The Thornrat can launch its spines as projectiles and quickly regenerate new ones. The creature never truly runs out of ammunition, making prolonged combat against multiple Thornrats exhausting.

### Plague Vector

The Thornrat carries numerous diseases and infections. Those bitten or struck by spines are exposed to sickness, and even minor wounds from Thornrats have a tendency to become infected and fester.

### Colony Coordination

When multiple Thornrats work together, they coordinate their attacks with unsettling precision, timing salvos and charges to overwhelm defenses.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Thornrat's primary weakness – flames damage its spines, burn away the toxic secretions, and cause it pain. A single Thornrat can be dispatched with fire relatively easily, and entire colonies can be eliminated by burning infested areas, though the process is dangerous and time-consuming. The creatures are also vulnerable to disease-neutralizing magic and to poison resistance. In areas where Thornrats infest, preventing infestation means maintaining cleanliness and immediately disposing of corpses, rotting food, and waste. Communities dealing with Thornrat colonies often hire exterminators, though the risk of contracting disease during the process is high. The creatures themselves have no inherent value – their hide is too thin and diseased to tan, and their spines contain so much toxin that harvesting them is extraordinarily hazardous.
