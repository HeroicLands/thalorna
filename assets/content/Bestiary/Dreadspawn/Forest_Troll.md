# Appearance {#appearance}

![[frsttrll|Forest Troll]]{float: top-left}

The ancient oak in front of you shifts. Bark cracks like skin, and what you thought was gnarled wood straightens into limbs and a torso. Moss and vines slide away like falling robes, revealing skin as green as rotting wood beneath. The thing is twelve feet tall and built of nothing but raw power – limbs thick as tree trunks, hands like woven roots and bone. Its breath carries the smell of wet earth and decay. Leaves are matted in hair that might be vegetable or might be vermin. It does not make sound as it moves toward you, despite its size. It simply appears closer than it was.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Forest trolls are apex predators and territorial overlords of deep woodlands and ancient forests, creatures born from primal earth-magic and predatory hunger. These massive beings are supremely adapted to their woodland domains, moving through dense growth as easily as humanoids walk on open ground. Adventurers encounter them in old-growth forests, in wilderness regions reclaimed by nature, and in places where civilization has not penetrated deeply.

## Presentation

The Forest Troll stands twelve to fourteen feet tall, its body composed of dense muscle covered in skin that ranges from sickly green to brackish brown, textured like bark. Vines and roots seem partially integrated into its body rather than merely attached – they twine through its skin, sometimes moving with independent purpose. Its hair is a tangle of branches, leaves, and living growth; insects and small creatures nest within it. Its hands are enormous, more paw-like than humanoid, with fingers that taper to sharp points like thorns. Its feet are broad and splayed, resembling gnarled roots. Its eyes are deep-set and intelligent, colored an unsettling greenish-brown. Teeth fill its mouth in irregular rows, some resembling stone, some bone, some wood. The creature moves with unnatural silence despite its bulk, materializing in clearings rather than appearing to walk toward them. A faint stench of turned earth and advanced rot accompanies it.

## Key Behaviors

The Forest Troll claims enormous territories – sometimes entire forests – which it patrols with methodical determination. It knows every tree, every path, every clearing within its domain. The creature is absolutely territorial and will attack anything that enters its lands. It hunts actively, using its knowledge of the forest to corner prey and drive them into disadvantageous terrain. It shows intelligence in reading the habits of its prey, timing its attacks, and even wearing prey down through fear. It does not hunt for sport – only for feeding – but it will defend territory against any perceived threat regardless of hunger. When dormant between hunts, it remains in deep wilderness where it can rest undisturbed. It exhibits no social behavior toward other trolls; territorial conflicts between Forest Trolls are violent and total.

## Combat Strategy

The Forest Troll uses terrain as much as raw strength. It attacks prey at disadvantage, using the forest to separate individuals, force groups into narrow passages, and drive enemies toward hazards like cliffs or water. Its initial attack is usually a charge or grab attempt leveraging surprise and positioning. Once engaged, it relies on sheer strength and regeneration to outlast opponents. It will pursue fleeing prey through forest where its knowledge is absolute, but will not pursue beyond territory boundaries. When faced with clearly superior opposition, it retreats to its lair, relying on regeneration and territory knowledge to eventually overcome intruders.

## Attack Methods

### Crushing Grip

The troll grasps prey with one massive hand, attempting to crush or compress the target. Once it has hold, the troll keeps up the pressure, crushing its victim by degrees.

### Mighty Blow

The troll swings its fist or arms in devastating arcs, with impact enough to break bone and armor alike. Its reach lets it strike from a distance other close fighters cannot match.

### Grapple and Tear

When grappling prey, the troll can deliberately tear or rend, inflicting grievous wounds. The troll sometimes picks up grappled prey and throws them against trees, walls, or other fixed objects.

### Root Entanglement

The vines and roots integrated into the troll's body can extend outward, attempting to grapple and entangle prey. Multiple targets can be entangled simultaneously; the entanglement persists as long as the roots maintain contact.

## Special Abilities

### Woodland Camouflage

The Forest Troll's appearance lets it blend into forest surroundings almost completely. In dense woodland, it is nearly impossible to distinguish from its surroundings until it moves, and in its native forest it can surprise prey even when they are looking directly at it.

### Regeneration

The troll's body heals with supernatural speed in response to injury. Within its forest domain, regeneration is rapid; outside its territory, regeneration slows significantly. Sustained fire damage prevents regeneration entirely as long as the fire is maintained. Severing the troll into pieces that cannot reattach requires total destruction of all pieces.

### Limb Regrowth

Lost limbs, even vital ones, regenerate over time. A severed arm may regrow within hours; a destroyed torso requires days or weeks. The troll's body has no obvious vital organs – damage is distributed and diffuse.

### Forest Manipulation

The Forest Troll can command plant growth to entangle, obscure, or attack enemies. Vines ensnare, branches block, roots erupt from soil to attack. This is no spell; it is a natural extension of the troll's will, and the forest obeys its oldest predator.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Forest Troll's primary weakness, burning living wood and preventing regeneration. Water-based magic has limited effect. The creature is most vulnerable outside its claimed forest territory, where regeneration slows and it cannot use environmental advantage. Some Forest Trolls have been observed tolerating specific smaller creatures or even humanoid populations within their territory, so long as they do not threaten the troll or its forest. Such arrangements are uneasy truces that can shatter if the balance is disturbed.
