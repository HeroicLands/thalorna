# Appearance {#appearance}

![[thndrhrn|Thunderhorn]]{float: top-left}

The air crackles with static before you see it—the hair on your arms stands on end and the smell of ozone floods your senses. Then it appears, rising like a storm made flesh: a creature vaguely rhinoceros-like but far larger, its hide the color of weathered storm clouds, dark gray and deep blue shot through with veins of sickly phosphorescence. Spiraling horns rise from its head, each one thick as a man's arm and wreathed in constant, writhing bolts of blue-white electricity that fork and branch into the air with terrible beauty. Its eyes are those of an ancient, intelligent creature, and they burn with the pale fire of lightning trapped in flesh. Each movement it makes seems to disrupt the air itself, creating pressure waves and small arcs of electrical discharge. The sound it makes is like distant thunder, and the ground trembles beneath its hooves.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Thunderhorns are creatures of electrical power and territorial fury, massive beasts that seem to have been infused with the lightning of storms. They roam tempestuous highlands and storm-swept plateaus where regular lightning strikes are common, seemingly feeding on the electrical energy of thunderstorms. A Thunderhorn's presence is often announced by changes in weather—sudden electric static in the air, the smell of ozone, and the sight of lightning arcing between ground and sky. These creatures are generally solitary and temperamental, becoming ferociously aggressive when threatened or when their territory is invaded. Some ancient Thunderhorns are said to be powerful enough to call down lightning strikes at will, though whether this is truth or legend remains unclear.

## Presentation

A Thunderhorn measures roughly 15 to 22 feet in length with a height of 10 to 14 feet, with a massively muscled body resembling a rhinoceros or buffalo crossed with something more primal and terrible. Its hide is thick and tough, the color of storm clouds—dark gray, deep blue, and purple-black—with veins of sickly luminescence running through it that glow faintly in darkness. Its defining features are its horns: two massive, spiraling appendages of tremendous length and sharpness, wreathed in constant, living arcs of electricity. These horns are so saturated with electrical charge that they seem to vibrate at the edge of physical reality, and they discharge bolts of lightning continuously into the surrounding air. Its eyes are pale, almost white, and they burn with contained electricity. Its hooves are heavy and black as charred coal, and where it walks, the ground is sometimes fused and cracked from the heat of its electrical discharge.

## Key Behaviors

A Thunderhorn claims a territory of considerable size—usually several miles of highland or exposed plateau—and it patrols its domain regularly. The creature seems attracted to storms and high places where lightning is common, as though feeding on the electrical energy present. It is generally solitary and does not seem to breed frequently, though during breeding season multiple Thunderhorns may appear in a region, creating hazardous conditions as they compete for mates and territory. The creature is intelligent enough to understand concepts like intrusion and threat, and it has been observed to deliberately move toward weather patterns it seems to desire.

## Combat Strategy

A Thunderhorn initiates combat by charging with its full mass and speed, attempting to gore opponents on its electrified horns or to ram them with shoulder and body. The creature's electrical discharge is as much a weapon as its physical form, burning even targets that avoid direct contact. It is slow and ponderous but possesses such strength that its attacks are nearly impossible to defend against through ordinary means. The creature seems immune to its own electrical discharges and resistant to external electrical attacks, relying on these advantages to dominate opponents. A wounded Thunderhorn becomes more aggressive, charging with less tactical awareness and more reckless power. Only truly overwhelming force will convince one to retreat, and even then it will attempt to take its attacker with it.

## Attack Methods

### Electrified Charge

The Thunderhorn lowers its horns and charges with terrible speed and force, attempting to gore the target. The horns discharge massive amounts of electrical energy simultaneously, and the impact combines crushing physical force with a searing electrical shock.

### Thunderous Stomp

The creature raises one of its massive hooves and brings it down with devastating force, creating a shockwave that radiates outward. The impact is accompanied by a burst of electrical discharge that radiates outward in a cone.

### Electrical Discharge

Without charging, the Thunderhorn can channel electricity through its body and horns, creating a sphere or cone of electrical energy that scorches everything within it.

## Special Abilities

### Electrical Embodiment

The Thunderhorn is composed partially of electrical energy and is highly resistant to lightning. Lightning strikes provide it sustenance, and thunderstorms energize it, making it faster and stronger during inclement weather.

### Lightning Authority

The Thunderhorn can call lightning from storm clouds, though this ability seems limited and requires some moments of concentration. The creature is most likely to use this ability in open terrain during active storms.

### Primal Fury

When injured or cornered, the Thunderhorn's electrical discharge increases dramatically, and it enters a state of heightened aggression where it attacks with reckless abandon, its discharges growing fiercer as its judgment fails.

## Additional Information

Earth-based magic and grounding effects are the Thunderhorn's primary weakness, as they can dissipate or redirect its electrical discharges and prevent it from building up charge. The creature is also vulnerable to water, which conducts electricity away and can quench its natural abilities if sufficient quantities are applied. The creature's horns, if somehow harvested from a slain Thunderhorn, retain electrical charge for years or even longer, making them extraordinarily valuable for crafting weapons or foci of electrical magic. The hide can be fashioned into armor that retains some electrical resistance. Hunting a Thunderhorn is considered a supremely dangerous undertaking, and most communities in Thunderhorn territory learn to simply avoid the creatures' ranges rather than attempting to oppose them.
