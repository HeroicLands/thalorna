# Appearance {#appearance}

![[tskcrshr|Tuskcrasher]]{float: top-left}

The forest ahead explodes—trees splinter and crash as something massive tears through them without regard for the obstacles in its path. You have only a moment to see it fully before it's upon you: a creature like a boar or wild pig magnified to nightmarish proportions, easily thirty feet in length, its muscular body covered in coarse hair bristling like pike-points. Enormous tusks curve upward and outward from its lower jaw, each one as thick as a man's arm and honed to terrible sharpness, capable of splitting stone. Its small, malevolent eyes glow with incandescent fury and fixated on you with the certainty of a predator that intends your death. The smell is overwhelming—musk and animal rage and the splintered wood of the trees it has recently destroyed. Then it simply charges, and there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide that would be fast enough.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Tuskcrashers are territorial rage given flesh, corrupted wild boars driven to impossible size and strength. They are the undisputed rulers of deep forests and woodland regions, creatures that have claimed vast territories and defend them with suicidal ferocity against all comers. A Tuskcrasher seems less interested in hunting for food and more interested in eliminating any potential threat to its dominion—the creature will attack settlements, wayfarers, and other creatures with equal viciousness. An old Tuskcrasher has left a trail of destruction across its territory measured in decades, and it becomes increasingly hostile and aggressive with age, as though its hatred of intrusion deepens with every passing year.

## Presentation

A Tuskcrasher stands 14 to 18 feet in height at the shoulder, with a length exceeding 30 feet from snout to rump. Its body is essentially a scaled-up version of a wild boar—massively muscled, covered in coarse hair that stands on end when the creature is agitated, and colored in dark brown, black, or muddy gray. Its hide is thick enough to deflect arrows, and it bears the scars of countless territorial conflicts with other large predators and with humans who have attempted to oppose it. Its most distinctive features are its tusks: enormous, curved appendages of terrible sharpness that extend upward and outward from the lower jaw, capable of reaching lengths of 8 to 12 feet. These tusks are used as primary weapons and as tools for tearing through obstacles. The creature's eyes are small and glowing red, burning with rage and hostile intelligence. Its sound is a constant huffing, snorting breath broken by ear-shattering squeals of fury.

## Key Behaviors

A Tuskcrasher claims a territory spanning ten to twenty miles or more, depending on the creature's age and power, and it defends every inch of that territory with absolute ferocity. The creature establishes wallows and preferred resting areas throughout its territory and follows regular routes in its patrols. It seems drawn to areas of dense forest and broken terrain where its charging tactics are most effective. The creature is primarily nocturnal but will hunt during the day if provoked or if prey is available. A Tuskcrasher seems to breed rarely, and a gravid female becomes so aggressive that entire regions become nearly impassable. An ancient Tuskcrasher may have held the same territory for centuries, and the forest around it bears the permanent scars of its passage.

## Combat Strategy

A Tuskcrasher initiates combat by lowering its head and charging at maximum speed, attempting to gore opponents on its tusks or to ram them with its massive shoulder. It relies purely on direct force, using its overwhelming strength to crush and destroy obstacles and opponents alike. The creature is methodical rather than tactical—it will charge the same direction repeatedly if that strategy is working, and it shows little capacity to change tactics or adapt to new circumstances. Once engaged, it fights with relentless fury, the rage driving it forward despite injuries that would slow lesser creatures. The Tuskcrasher will fight to the death rather than retreat, and its death throes are so violent that even in dying it can cause catastrophic damage.

## Attack Methods

### Goring Charge

The Tuskcrasher lowers its head and charges at full speed, attempting to gore opponents on its tusks. The combined force of the creature's mass and speed makes this attack nearly impossible to defend against or dodge.

### Tusk Strike

With tusks raised, the creature uses its tusks as slashing weapons, capable of cleaving through flesh, bone, and wood alike. Multiple strikes can be delivered if prey remains in close proximity.

### Destructive Trampling

Once an opponent is down, the Tuskcrasher will deliberately trample them, using its massive hooves to crush whatever lies beneath.

## Special Abilities

### Forest Authority

The Tuskcrasher moves through dense forest and broken terrain with surprising ease, and its movement speed increases in such environments. It can crash through obstacles that would stop lesser creatures, clearing paths through forest or stone with its body.

### Relentless Aggression

The Tuskcrasher does not tire. It will fight continuously for hours or days without rest, and its rage only intensifies as combat continues. Wounds make the creature faster and stronger, not slower.

### Hide Resilience

The Tuskcrasher's thick hide and massive size grant it resistance to physical damage. Most conventional weapons cause minimal damage unless the creature can be prevented from moving or unless attacks focus on vulnerable points.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Tuskcrasher's primary vulnerability—flames damage its thick hide and cause it pain and distress. Sustained heat can eventually drive a Tuskcrasher away, though only a very hot fire will stop a determined charge. Agility-based combat tactics and ranged attacks can exploit the creature's slow reflexes and low dexterity, though this takes great skill and coordination. The creature's tusks, if harvested from a slain specimen, are extraordinarily valuable and can be crafted into weapons or building materials of rare quality and durability. The hide can be tanned into leather tough enough to stop arrows. Some cultures have built entire traditions around hunting Tuskcrashers, and successful hunters are celebrated for the rest of their lives. The corpse of a slain Tuskcrasher is valuable enough to support an expedition for months.
