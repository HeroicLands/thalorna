# Appearance {#appearance}

![[feraldew|Feraldew]]{float: top-left}

A graceful deer stands in the meadow with the others—gentle eyes, soft coat, modest antlers. Then it turns its head and smiles. Fangs gleam where no fangs should be, and its eyes are wrong—cold and calculating where they should be warm. When it moves, the wrongness becomes clear: no natural deer moves with such predatory precision. You've been watching it the whole time and never realized it wasn't a deer at all.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Feraldews are corrupted cervids, creatures of deception and hidden violence that infiltrate normal herds and hunt with the patience of ambush predators. These creatures are not natural animals—something has twisted them from within, giving them predatory intelligence wrapped in familiar flesh. Adventurers encounter them in forests and grasslands, often not realizing they're present until already surrounded. They are particularly dangerous because hunters and travelers lower their guard around what appears to be normal wildlife.

## Presentation

The Feraldew appears to be a graceful buck roughly the size of a large deer, with a modest rack of branching antlers that seem purely natural. Its coat is dappled brown and cream, soft and seemingly healthy. Its eyes are large and expressive, appearing gentle and innocent at casual glance. However, closer inspection reveals wrong details: the too-sharp geometry of its face, the way its joints bend at unnatural angles, the fact that its teeth are all razor-sharp fangs. Its hooves are thickened, calloused, and can unfold into multi-jointed appendages ending in hooked talons. Its movements are graceful until the moment they become predatory—a sudden shift in demeanor that reveals the creature's true nature. The hide is tougher than any natural deer's, capable of resisting significant damage.

## Key Behaviors

The Feraldew lurks within herds of normal deer, camouflaging itself through proximity and borrowed identity. It has no interest in consuming normal deer; instead, it hunts predators and humanoids, using the herd both as camouflage and as bait. When threats approach the herd, the Feraldew waits patiently, allowing other deer to flee or be taken, then strikes with calculated fury. It understands how others will behave and exploits that understanding. It is fiercely territorial and will attack anything that moves too aggressively within its claimed meadow or forest. When satisfied with feeding, it can remain dormant for weeks, blending invisibly with normal herds. It shows no social behavior toward other Feraldews; if multiple inhabit the same region, they maintain separate territories.

## Combat Strategy

The Feraldew wins through surprise and positioning. It typically initiates combat only when it has the advantage—the target surrounded by deer, confused about the location of the threat, or already partially committed to attacking what appears to be normal prey. Its opening attack is a charge with antlers lowered, attempting to gore from a distance. If that succeeds, it immediately transitions to close-range bite attacks. If the opponent escapes the initial charge, the Feraldew rears up and uses its hooked talons in slashing combinations. It fights with cold intelligence, not rage, and will disengage if the fight turns against it, melting back into the herd or fleeing into forest. It shows particular cunning in using herd animals as obstacles and escape routes.

## Attack Methods

### Antler Gore

The Feraldew lowers its head and charges with considerable force, attempting to gore the target with its dagger-like antlers. The charge adds its speed to the blow, and it can impale lightly armored targets.

### Fanged Bite

Once close with a target, the Feraldew bites with surprising ferocity, delivering deep puncture wounds and potentially tearing away chunks of flesh or armor. The bite is designed to wound rather than kill outright.

### Talon Rending

When the Feraldew rears up on hind legs, its hooked talons extend from its hooves and rake downward in precise, devastating slashes. Multiple talon strikes in rapid succession can open severe wounds.

## Special Abilities

### Deceptive Form

The Feraldew's appearance allows it to blend into normal herds. Most observers seeing it at distance cannot distinguish it from natural deer without very careful observation. Within or near a herd it is nearly impossible to pick out.

### Unfolding Talons

The creature's hooves are deceptive—they unfold into multi-jointed appendages ending in curved, razor-sharp talons. These talons inflict grave wounds in combat and can be used for climbing or grappling as well as slashing attacks.

### Antler Defense

The Feraldew's antlers are not purely offensive weapons. They are extremely strong and dense, and the creature uses them to block and deflect incoming attacks. The antlers also protect the head, reducing damage from overhead or frontal strikes.

### Herd Camouflage

The creature is never fully alone if normal deer are present. It uses herds as cover, moving through them to break line of sight or to circle prey. The presence of panicked or fleeing deer provides effective concealment and distraction.

## Additional Information

Feraldews are vulnerable to fire, which damages their hide severely and causes pain that breaks their composure. They are less dangerous when separated from herds, as they lose both camouflage and tactical advantage. Once a Feraldew is identified, it loses much of its effectiveness—the deception is the primary weapon. Experienced hunters note that Feraldew herds behave differently from normal deer—movements are too coordinated, responses too organized—and that multiple "deer" in a herd may turn out to be corrupted infiltrators.
