# Appearance {#appearance}

![[abyssdrk|Abyssdrake]]{float: top-left}

The temperature drops as a sinuous shape moves through the water—a body serpentine and scaled in deepest obsidian, barely visible even in daylight. When it turns, its eyes burn with cold, actinic blue light, and along its spine, jagged fins trail a luminescence of sickly green and purple. The stench reaches you first—brine mixed with something sulfurous, decaying, wrong. Its scales catch the light in ways that hurt to watch.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Abyssdrakes are draconic hunters born in crushing oceanic depths or caverns so dark that light becomes a weapon against them. These creatures are ambush predators of rare intelligence, dwelling in sunken ruins, abyssal trenches, and underwater passages between worlds. Adventurers may encounter an Abyssdrake guarding forbidden places—ruined temples, portals, or grotesquely corrupted sanctuaries—where the creature has made its lair.

## Presentation

The creature resembles a slender, wingless drake roughly twenty to thirty feet in length, its body covered in obsidian-black scales that seem to absorb light rather than reflect it. Its head tapers to a pointed snout lined with backward-curving teeth; above each eye, a ridge of jagged, backward-pointing fins protrudes. A mane of similar spikes runs the length of its spine, each one rimmed in phosphorescent violet or sickly green. Its claws are elongated and wickedly sharp, resembling black iron. It moves with predatory grace, equally at home in water and on land, and produces a low, thrumming hiss that vibrates in bone and chest.

## Key Behaviors

The Abyssdrake hunts in isolation, claiming vast territories as its own. It lurks in the deepest parts of its domain—lightless caverns, sunken ruins, narrow passages where its sinuous form gives it advantage. The creature is a patient hunter, willing to remain motionless for days to ambush prey. It exhibits tool-like reasoning in selecting and defending its hunting ground; it may even attempt to drive competitors from its territory without eating them, establishing dominance. When wounded or threatened with starvation, it becomes erratic and aggressive.

## Combat Strategy

The Abyssdrake favors ambush from darkness or murky water, striking from concealment to wound prey with teeth and claws before withdrawing to assess. In prolonged combat, it uses terrain to break line of sight, regenerating its wounds from the shadows. It does not fight to the death—if an encounter turns unfavorably, it flees into deepest water, knowing pursuers cannot follow. It shows particular cunning in using confined spaces against larger or multiple foes.

## Attack Methods

### Serpent Bite

The creature lunges with its full body behind a devastating bite attack, attempting to seize and crush prey in its jaws. The bite does terrible damage; once it has a grip, it can hold prey in its mouth and drag them toward deeper water.

### Shadow Claws

Raking attacks with its fore-claws rake and tear armor, cloth, and flesh alike. The creature uses these in combination with its bite, attempting to immobilize prey long enough to drag them to deeper, darker ground.

### Corrosive Breath

The drake exhales a stream of caustic vapor and fluid that dissolves flesh and corrodes armor. The burns it leaves go on eating into exposed skin for some time after the breath itself has passed.

## Special Abilities

### Shadow Adaptation

The Abyssdrake is nearly invisible in darkness or murky water. In dim light or shadow it is very hard to spot, and in complete darkness its strikes land on creatures that cannot see in the dark before they know it is there.

### Regeneration

Drawn from deep places where natural law frays, the creature regenerates slowly from wounds. So long as it remains in darkness or water, it heals at an accelerated rate; sunlight and prolonged exposure to bright light halts regeneration entirely.

### Aquatic Propulsion

The drake's sinuous body and powerful tail give it great speed in water, allowing it to move faster than most swimmers and to maneuver in ways land-bound creatures cannot match.

## Additional Information

Abyssdrakes are vulnerable to sustained light exposure; creatures wielding light-generating items (enchanted torches, magical spells) can drive one from its lair or prevent it from regenerating. Abyssdrakes may be partly extraplanar in nature, which would explain their resistance to conventional weapons and their seeming indifference to depth pressure.
