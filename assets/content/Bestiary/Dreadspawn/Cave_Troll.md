# Appearance {#appearance}

![[cvtrll|Cave Troll]]{float: top-left}

The darkness moves. A shape detaches itself from the shadows of the cave wall – pale, skeletal, impossibly tall. You smell something wild and foul, something ancient and wrong. Then you hear it: a wet, rhythmic breathing that echoes off stone, and the scrape of something sharp – claws, many of them – dragging across rock. Its eyes catch the faint light like mirrors, tiny and bright with hunger, and it smiles. The mouth is too wide.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Cave trolls are monstrous apex predators of deep cavern systems and underground kingdoms, powerful hunters that have never seen daylight. These creatures are slow of thought but devastating in combat, relying on senses far keener than any humanoid's to hunt in absolute darkness. Adventurers encounter them in extensive cave networks, at the boundaries between civilized cavern settlements and wild underground territories, and in mountain ranges riddled with deep passages.

## Presentation

The Cave Troll stands between ten and twelve feet tall, its body an exaggeration of predatory form. Its skin is pale, almost translucent in places, with a faintly luminescent sheen – blue-white and veined with darkly discolored areas suggesting corruption. The creature's limbs are long and disproportionately thin relative to its torso, ending in hands with four elongated fingers tipped in curved, razor-sharp claws. Its head is elongated and angular, with a jaw that extends unnaturally far and teeth – rows of them, serrated and wickedly pointed – that never fully close. Its eyes are small, bright, and pupilless, glowing faintly with bioluminescence. The creature produces a constant wet, rattling breathing and the sound of claws dragging against stone as it moves.

## Key Behaviors

The Cave Troll is a solitary stalker of cavern passages, claiming vast underground territories as hunting grounds. It dwells in the deepest parts of cave systems where light never penetrates, resting in concealed caverns and hunting along established routes where prey gathers. The creature has an almost supernatural ability to track prey by scent and sound alone; it hunts methodically, following prey through passages and waiting for opportunity. It exhibits territorial behavior, attacking any large creature that enters its domain. When successful in a hunt, it drags prey back to its lair to feed. It shows no interest in hoarding or collecting – only hunting and feeding.

## Combat Strategy

The Cave Troll attacks from darkness and concealment, using its sensory advantage to identify and target prey before they can react. It charges when close enough to strike, relying on overwhelming strength and viciousness. When struck by weapon or spell, it responds with blind fury, attacking wildly without tactical consideration. It does not flee from combat except when severely injured or facing apparent death; it will pursue fleeing prey through cavern passages where its movement advantage is greatest, but ceases pursuit if prey reaches open ground or sunlight. It sometimes uses its horrifying roar as a weapon, attempting to panic or disorient groups of foes.

## Attack Methods

### Raking Claws

The troll slashes viciously with its fore-claws, attempting to tear through armor and flesh alike. Multiple claw strikes in rapid succession are the creature's preferred pattern of attack.

### Terrible Bite

The troll lunges with its oversized jaw, attempting to seize and crush prey or tear away entire limbs. This bite does devastating harm and – if the creature successfully grapples with prey – can be held while the troll shakes and worries the victim.

### Shocking Roar

The creature emits a deafening, inarticulate howl that reverberates through cavern passages. This roar causes disorientation and panic in those who hear it and can temporarily deafen sensitive creatures.

## Special Abilities

### Darkvision and Sensory Dominance

The Cave Troll perceives its subterranean environment through a combination of acute hearing, a keen nose, and subtle bioluminescent sight. It functions perfectly in absolute darkness and holds a significant advantage in any underground environment. Light sources disorient and weaken it; in bright light it perceives poorly and its attacks go astray.

### Regeneration

The troll's body heals with supernatural speed. Minor wounds close within minutes; more serious injuries regenerate within hours if undisturbed. Sustained damage from fire or magical effects halts regeneration temporarily. True death requires either total destruction (severing the body into pieces that cannot reattach) or exposure to sustained sunlight.

### Tunnel Supremacy

The Cave Troll's thin frame allows it to navigate tight cavern passages that would be impassable to wider creatures. It moves through vertical shafts, narrow chimneys, and complex tunnel networks with ease, giving it pursuit and escape advantages in underground terrain.

## Additional Information

Cave trolls fear sunlight more than any other force – extended exposure to bright daylight can weaken and eventually kill them. They also show unusual vulnerability to fire, which prevents regeneration entirely as long as it's sustained. Most cave troll lairs are marked by the bones and torn armor of previous meals, creating a distinctive and disturbing sign. Some very old lairs have become cavern ossuaries of immense depth.
