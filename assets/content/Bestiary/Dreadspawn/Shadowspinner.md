# Appearance {#appearance}

![[shdwspnn|Shadowspinner]]{float: top-left}

You feel it before you see it—a sudden, terrible weight pressing against your chest as though the very shadows have turned solid and begun to strangle. Then you see them, or rather you see the absence—walls of something too dark to be spider silk, hung from corner to corner of the chamber, blocking light and obscuring sight. And within those walls of woven shadow, a shape moves with predatory grace—a spider the size of a horse, its body armored in gleaming black chitin, its eight eyes burning like poisonous topazes. The sound of its mandibles is the sound of bone breaking, and the silk it trails behind it seems to drink in light itself, leaving darker shadows than the surrounding darkness.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Shadowspinners are apex arachnids corrupted by some infernal magic into creatures of terrible intelligence and supernatural predation. These creatures engineer elaborate traps that capture prey and break the spirit of those who see them. A Shadowspinner weaves webs that seem to drink light and hope, webs that can hold a grown warrior immobilized for weeks. They haunt deep caves, sunken ruins, and places so dark that normal light seems to turn sick and dim. A Shadowspinner's presence is said to drive other creatures away; few things will venture into a chamber ruled by one of these monsters.

## Presentation

A Shadowspinner measures roughly 10 to 14 feet in length with a legspan of 20 to 30 feet or more. Its body is covered in plates of glossy black chitin that seem to swallow light, and its legs are jointed and furred with what appears to be metallic, almost fur-like hair that catches light like obsidian filaments. Its head bears eight eyes arranged in two groups of four, each eye glowing with a faint, sickly luminescence—some amber, some violet, some a sickly phosphorescent white. Its mandibles are tremendous, capable of grinding through bone, and they glisten with venom that seems to smoke faintly in warm air. Most distinctive are its spinnerets, which produce webs of impossible strength and darkness—thread so black it seems to be liquid shadow made solid. The creature moves with eerie grace on its jointed legs, and the sound is of chitinous plates scraping together, or sometimes of something more like wind whispering through a graveyard.

## Key Behaviors

A Shadowspinner claims a territory and then systematically transforms it into a web-fortress of staggering complexity. It spends much of its time constructing and maintaining the web, building in geometric patterns that seem almost mathematical in their precision. The creature is solitary, fiercely territorial, and will attack other Shadowspinners on sight. It hunts by detecting vibrations in its web—minute tremors from struggling prey are like music to it. An ancient Shadowspinner may spend decades in a single location, its web growing ever larger and more complex until the entire chamber or cavern is a three-dimensional labyrinth of predatory silk.

## Combat Strategy

A Shadowspinner initiates combat by assuming a position in its web where it has maximum mobility and advantage. It moves with speed that seems wrong for an insect of its size, using its limbs to hang, swing, and position itself with three-dimensional combat awareness. It uses the web itself as a weapon, tightening strands around prey, creating barriers, and manipulating the environment to its advantage. The creature is intelligent enough to recognize overwhelming force and will attempt to retreat deeper into its web or sever key threads to collapse sections and slow pursuit. When cornered or protecting its nest, it attacks with venomous bites and slashing limbs in a coordinated dance of predation.

## Attack Methods

### Venomous Bite

The Shadowspinner's mandibles snap forward with terrible force, driving long chelicerae deep into flesh and injecting a potent neurotoxin that begins working immediately. Bitten targets feel a spreading numbness and a creeping paralysis.

### Raking Limbs

The creature's legs are weaponized, tipped with natural points that can pierce armor and rip through flesh. Multiple limbs can strike simultaneously, and the Shadowspinner uses them in coordinated patterns difficult to defend against.

### Web Entanglement

The creature uses its web not as a passive trap but as an active weapon, tightening strands around prey, constricting, and creating hazardous terrain that impedes movement and prevents escape.

## Special Abilities

### Web Mastery

The Shadowspinner commands its web with complete perfection, capable of manipulating tension, creating new connections, or severing old ones instantly. The web can bear enormous weight, stretch to surprising distances, and move in response to the creature's will.

### Vibration Sense

The Shadowspinner perceives the world primarily through vibrations in its web, detecting even microscopic movements with precision. In its web, it essentially has perfect awareness of everything touching it, and attempting to hide from it is futile.

### Predatory Intellect

The Shadowspinner is intelligent and plans ahead. It remembers prey that escape, learns patterns, and builds more elaborate traps each time. It has been known to alter its behavior based on the weapons or tactics of repeating opponents.

### Venom Resistance

The Shadowspinner is immune to most poisons and venoms, allowing it to feed on creatures that would be lethal to other animals.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Shadowspinner's primary weakness—flame damages its web immediately, destroys its exoskeleton, and sends the creature into a panic. A sufficiently large fire can drive a Shadowspinner to abandon its territory entirely. The silk itself, if harvested carefully before the creature dies, is extraordinarily valuable—capable of holding tremendous weight and naturally resistant to most damage. Dark scholars and assassins prize Shadowspinner silk for creating nets, bindings, and armor. The creature's fangs can be crafted into weapons that retain venom for years. Some hunters make their living by raiding Shadowspinner territories, removing the creature, and harvesting its web and body parts—though the casualty rate for such work is terrifyingly high.
