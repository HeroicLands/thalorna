# Appearance {#appearance}

![[mrrrlng|Mirrorling]]{float: top-left}

Dozens of versions of you stare back from a perfectly smooth, humanoid surface before you—each reflection fractionally out of sync with the others, as though time itself has splintered. The creature's surface ripples without touching water, light bending across its body in impossible angles that make your eyes water when you try to track its movements. A low, crystalline hum emanates from it, and you realize with creeping dread that one of the reflections isn't reflecting you at all—it's watching you independently, with terrible intelligence.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Mirrorlings are living paradoxes born from the collision of light, memory, and malice—creatures of pure manifestation that exist as much in reflection as in flesh. They are drawn to places where light scatters and multiplies: halls of mirrors, crystal caverns, sunlit waters, and the chambers of vain nobles. A Mirrorling's true nature is to fracture and confuse, using light as a weapon and illusion as a shield. The creature is said to feed not on flesh but on the reflection of violence—the more brutally an opponent attacks and misses, the stronger it becomes. One tale makes Mirrorlings the remnants of mages who gazed too long into their own vanity, corrupted into beings of pure reflection and spite.

## Presentation

A Mirrorling presents an unsettling humanoid form roughly 6 to 8 feet in height, composed entirely of a perfectly reflective, liquid-smooth surface like burnished quicksilver or polished steel. Its body has defined musculature and articulation, but the joints bend with an unnatural fluidity, as though the thing has no bone or cartilage—just frictionless motion. Its face is a blank, featureless mirror when viewed directly, yet reflections within its surface show eyes of impossible depth, sometimes countless, sometimes singular. The creature moves with liquid grace, its form occasionally seeming to blur or double, and it leaves no footprints or disturbance in its wake. The temperature drops noticeably near a Mirrorling, and the air carries a faint scent of ozone and burned silver.

## Key Behaviors

Mirrorlings are solitary and territorial, claiming reflective spaces as their domains. They are drawn to moments of violence and bloodshed, arriving unbidden to feed on the chaos of conflict. Unlike most predators, they do not hunger for food—instead, they consume the "echo" of an attack: the energy of a blow striking their surface and rebounding. A Mirrorling that has fed on many failed attacks against it grows stronger and faster. They show a perverse curiosity about mortal vanity and will sometimes linger in the chambers of vain nobles, seemingly amused by their prey's futile attempts at self-admiration. A Mirrorling rarely remains in one location indefinitely; after weeks or months, it will disappear into the nearest large body of reflective water or through a shattered mirror, not to be seen again in that place.

## Combat Strategy

A Mirrorling opens combat by using its natural reflectivity to create the illusion of multiple versions of itself, positioning these illusory forms to confuse and misdirect attacks. It moves constantly, using the terrain to maximize reflections and reinforce the illusion of greater numbers. Each strike against the creature that misses strengthens its defenses slightly, and it counts on that to outlast opponents. When facing ranged attackers, a Mirrorling may position itself to redirect projectiles back toward the archer. If cornered or facing an opponent who lands consistent hits, it attempts to break line-of-sight and escape into the nearest reflective surface—a mirror, a pool of water, or polished stone.

## Attack Methods

### Reflective Blade Strike

The creature's limbs sharpen into edges of pure crystalline reflection, striking with surprising force and precision. These strikes leave wounds that seem to warp and distort, as though the flesh itself is confused about where it should be.

### Mirrored Retaliation

When an opponent's attack glances off the creature's reflective surface, that same force is redirected back toward the attacker with perfect geometric precision. A sword swing might be sent back as a cutting beam of refracted light; an arrow might be turned aside to strike a nearby ally.

## Special Abilities

### Reflective Embodiment

The creature's body reflects and refracts light with impossible perfection, making it extraordinarily difficult to strike. Physical attacks against it often go astray, and many strikes seem to pass through or around it without landing.

### Fractured Image

The Mirrorling can create illusory duplicates of itself through careful manipulation of light and reflection. At least two of the images will move independently and seem tactilely real, forcing opponents to guess which version is the real one.

### Void Reflection

When looking into the Mirrorling's surface, perceptive creatures can glimpse fleeting, disturbing images: scenes of violence, moments of vanity, glimpses of the creature's feeding. Those who stare too long begin to feel distant and unreal to themselves.

## Additional Information

Darkness and non-reflective environments pose the greatest challenge to a Mirrorling, negating both its illusory and defensive advantages. Magical attacks that create obscurement or shadow leave the creature fighting on nearly even terms. If a Mirrorling is forced to remain in absolute darkness for more than a few minutes, it begins to weaken, its form becoming sluggish and brittle. The creature is vulnerable to spells that damage or cloud reflective surfaces, including rusted metals, broken glass, and muddied water. Destroying every mirror in a Mirrorling's territory may starve it, forcing it to move on or perish. The creature's remains—if it is slain—dissolve into mercury-like drops that evaporate within hours, leaving no physical trace.
