# Appearance {#appearance}

![[phsphrsc|Phosphorescent Globule]]{float: top-left}

In the deepest darkness, a luminous green glow blooms like a sickly flower. The light pulses and intensifies hypnotically, drawing your eye and making it impossible to look away—beautiful, almost, in its promise of warmth and guidance in the lightless place. Then, as the glow brightens, you realize the light is not coming from ahead but from all around you, and the source is a rolling, gelatinous mass that moves like slow water given form. Its surface writhes and undulates with nauseating grace, and where the acidic slime touches the stone, it hisses and smokes. You can taste the faint burn in the air—caustic, alien, wrong.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Phosphorescent Globule is a predatory ooze of supreme cunning that hunts through deception rather than direct assault. It manifests as a near-mindless creature in its behavior yet employs tactics that suggest terrible intelligence, using its bioluminescence as both lure and weapon. These creatures are found exclusively in deep, lightless caves and underground lakes where their glow stands out as a beacon in the darkness. A Phosphorescent Globule can slowly consume an entire ecosystem by drawing creatures to it with promises of light before dissolving them in its acidic body. One theory holds that these oozes are manifestations of corrupted magic rather than natural creatures, capable of spontaneous generation wherever enough ambient arcane energy concentrates in darkness.

## Presentation

A Phosphorescent Globule typically manifests as a roughly spherical blob measuring 4 to 8 feet in diameter, though it can elongate, flatten, or reconfigure its shape with unsettling ease. Its form is entirely translucent or semi-transparent, composed of a gelatinous substance that is sickly green or pale blue in color and radiates a pulsing bioluminescence from within. Inside the mass, shapes and colors shift constantly—swirling patterns of light, sometimes resembling eyes or mouths or writhing forms, though these are likely just tricks of refracted luminescence. Where the creature moves, the ground steams and hisses as its acidic body slowly consumes stone and organic matter. The temperature drops noticeably near a Phosphorescent Globule, and the air carries a faint scent of burning acid and ozone.

## Key Behaviors

A Phosphorescent Globule is a patient, nearly sedentary predator that settles in a location and waits for creatures to be drawn to it. It does not seek prey actively but instead emanates its glow constantly, trusting in the irresistible draw of light in darkness to bring food to it. When prey approaches, it may flare its luminescence to confuse and distract, or it may dim it slowly, creating a hypnotic pulsing pattern designed to enthrall weaker minds. The creature seems to understand that some creatures will resist its lure and will attempt to prevent escape, positioning itself between prey and the exit before revealing its true nature. It grows larger as it feeds, and an old Phosphorescent Globule may be two or three times the size of a younger one.

## Combat Strategy

A Phosphorescent Globule opens combat by intensifying its luminescence, attempting to disorient and mesmerize opponents with dazzling light displays. Once prey is disoriented, it moves to engulf and dissolve them in its acidic body. The creature is slow-moving but very difficult to damage—physical attacks pass partially through its gelatinous form without causing lasting harm. If severely damaged, it can voluntarily fragment into multiple smaller globs, each capable of independent action, forcing opponents to deal with multiple threats simultaneously. A Phosphorescent Globule rarely retreats from combat; instead, it simply waits with eerie patience for an opening.

## Attack Methods

### Acidic Engulfment

The creature surges forward and attempts to envelop a target partially or wholly within its corrosive form. Those caught experience rapidly accelerating dissolution as the ooze exerts pressure and dissolves flesh, bone, and equipment alike.

### Blinding Flash

The creature's luminescence flares with brilliant intensity, flooding the area with overwhelming light that blinds and disorients those within range. Affected creatures struggle to track movement or coordinate attacks.

## Special Abilities

### Bioluminescent Lure

The creature's constant glow is hypnotic and compelling to creatures of weak will, drawing them inexorably closer despite conscious misgivings. Those of strong will or clear mind can resist the pull, but weaker minds find themselves walking toward the light as though compelled by strings.

### Fragmentation

When severely damaged, the Phosphorescent Globule can voluntarily split into multiple smaller globs, each with a fraction of the parent's size and strength. These fragments can act semi-independently to flank or surround opponents.

### Acidic Body

The Globule's very form is corrosive to most materials, slowly dissolving anything it touches. Weapons and armor exposed to the creature for prolonged periods suffer degradation, and flesh exposed directly to the creature is burned by the caustic slime.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Phosphorescent Globule's primary weakness—flames disrupt its bioluminescence and cause the acidic form to become unstable and painful. Extreme cold also damages it, hardening the gelatinous form and disrupting its movement and cohesion. The creature's luminescent organs, if harvested carefully after death, can be preserved and used as light sources or crafted into magical foci that retain dim bioluminescence for years. The creature's acidic secretions, properly neutralized and preserved, have value in alchemical processes. The greatest risk to removing a Phosphorescent Globule from an area is the certainty that if even a small fragment is left behind, it will regenerate into a full creature given enough time and food.
