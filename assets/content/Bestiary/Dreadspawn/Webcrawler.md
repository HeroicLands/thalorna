# Appearance {#appearance}

![[wbcrwlr|Webcrawler]]{float: top-left}

At first you cannot see it—there is only a shimmer in the air, something that might be dew on near-invisible thread, catching light that should not reach here. Then the spider itself emerges from hiding, and you see it: a creature the size of a human torso, its eight spindly legs moving with predatory grace, its body iridescent black with hints of deep purple and sickly green. The abdomen is grotesquely distended, constantly producing silken thread that glimmers with barely-visible luminescence. Its eyes are many-faceted and glowing, each one fixing on you with intelligent calculation. Fangs like curved needles protrude from its mouth, dripping venom that sizzles and steams when it touches stone. The air around it seems to vibrate with the tension of its web, and what you took for empty air is a labyrinth of nearly invisible threads, and you are already inside it.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Webcrawlers are creatures of silk and supreme cunning, spiders of supernatural intelligence that have made the hunting web into an art. They are found in dark, confined spaces—caverns, ruins, and the deep shadows of ancient structures—where their nearly invisible webs can be spread across three-dimensional terrain and prey cannot easily escape. A Webcrawler does not chase its prey; it waits, and builds elaborate traps meant to catch and entangle without fail. These creatures show intelligence and invention in the construction of their webs, and old Webcrawlers have been observed to create traps of stunning complexity that would take a human engineer months to design.

## Presentation

A Webcrawler measures roughly 5 to 7 feet in body length with a legspan extending an additional 8 to 12 feet, making the total creature comparable in size to a large humanoid. Its body is segmented and covered in an exoskeleton of deep black chitin with iridescent reflections of purple and green. Its legs are long and articulated, ending in sharp, adhesive points that allow it to climb any surface and cling to its webs with perfect grip. Its abdomen is distended and constantly glistening with the silk being produced. Its head bears eight eyes arranged in complex geometric patterns, each one burning with sickly luminescence. Its fangs are hollow chelicerae dripping constantly with venom of a greenish-white color that hisses and steams on contact with stone. The creature is nearly silent as it moves, and in darkness it is nearly invisible except for the faint glow of its eyes and the occasional glimmer of its webs.

## Key Behaviors

A Webcrawler claims a three-dimensional territory—usually a cavern, a series of connected chambers, or a multi-story structure—and fills it with an incredibly complex network of nearly invisible webs. The creature spends much of its time in maintenance and creation, constantly spinning new silk and improving its traps. The web network has several purposes: capturing prey, warning the creature of intruders, creating communication networks within the web itself, and providing a three-dimensional highway across otherwise impassable terrain. A Webcrawler shows signs of invention and planning—adjusting web designs based on prey type, creating false paths to lead prey into kill zones, and maintaining multiple tiers of web for different sizes of creatures. Ancient Webcrawlers have web networks of staggering complexity.

## Combat Strategy

A Webcrawler engages enemies primarily through entanglement in its webs. Once prey is caught, the creature moves with great speed along its webbing to attack with fangs. The creature avoids prolonged direct combat, instead relying on its web to control the battle space. It will first work to cut targets off from any escape through careful positioning and will use the web to restrict movement and prevent escape. If pressed hard, a Webcrawler will retreat deeper into its web network where it has perfect mobility and comprehensive knowledge of every inch of terrain. The creature fights to defend its web, not its own survival, and it will battle ferociously if its web is threatened.

## Attack Methods

### Paralytic Bite

The Webcrawler strikes with great speed, driving its fangs into flesh and injecting a potent neurotoxin. The venom begins working almost immediately, numbing the injection site and spreading through the body.

### Web Constriction

Rather than using web passively, the Webcrawler can actively manipulate the strands, tightening them around entangled prey, crushing and suffocating simultaneously.

### Guided Entanglement

The creature can manipulate its webs to create new traps on the fly, positioning sticky strands in paths prey might take and creating barriers that seem invisible until touched.

## Special Abilities

### Web Mastery

The Webcrawler commands its web network with perfect precision, capable of manipulating individual strands or entire sections simultaneously. The webs are nearly invisible, incredibly strong, and capable of supporting the creature's weight plus substantial additional burden.

### Silk Navigation

The creature moves across its webs with perfect grace and speed, treating three-dimensional web networks as a humanoid would treat ground. It can traverse vertical surfaces, hang from ceilings, and maneuver in ways that would be impossible for less specialized creatures.

### Predatory Creativity

The Webcrawler shows invention and the ability to solve problems in the design and construction of its web networks. It learns prey patterns, designs traps specifically for certain prey types, and adjusts its web designs based on success or failure.

### Venom Mastery

The Webcrawler's venom is potent and complex, causing a creeping paralysis, numbness, and eventual death. The venom seems designed to render prey immobile rather than kill quickly, allowing the creature to feed at leisure.

## Additional Information

Fire is the Webcrawler's primary weakness—flames destroy its web immediately and cause the creature severe distress. The destruction of a web section forces the Webcrawler to either retreat or spend time rebuilding. Acid is also effective against the web. Cold can slow the creature's venom production and metabolism. In areas where the creature is not supported by its web, it becomes slow and sluggish, losing much of its extraordinary agility. The silk itself is extraordinarily valuable—capable of being harvested and used for numerous purposes, from rope to specialized armor. Alchemists and crafters will pay substantial sums for high-quality Webcrawler silk. A Webcrawler's web of significant complexity can take months or years to construct, and the creature views its web almost as an extension of itself, becoming desperately aggressive if the web is threatened.
