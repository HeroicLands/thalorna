# Appearance {#appearance}

You round the outcropping of rust-colored stone and freeze. The heat hits you first—a visible shimmer rising from the canyon floor, so intense it makes your eyes water. Then you smell it: sulfur and something older, something primal. Your skin prickles with warning.

The young dragon is smaller than the legends promised, but the word _smaller_ holds no comfort as it shifts on the canyon ledge. Sixteen feet of coiled muscle and fury, with a wingspan that could eclipse the sun if it stretched. Its scales catch the light like hammered copper and burnished gold, each one overlapping in a pattern that speaks of restless youth and boundless aggression. A thin column of smoke rises from its nostrils, curling into pale ribbons.

It hasn't seen you yet, but it will.

The creature's movements are sharp, almost twitchy—the energy of adolescence barely contained in a body designed for destruction. It paces the ledge like a caged beast, claws scoring deep grooves in stone that should be impervious. Every motion radiates hunger: hunger for territory, for gold, for glory, for the chance to prove it can burn down anything that challenges its dominance. This is no cunning ancient wyrm waiting in its lair; it is a killer still learning the full depth of its power, with everything to prove and nothing to lose.

The dragon's head snaps toward a distant sound—a rockslide perhaps, or a frightened animal. It launches from the ledge with a roar that scorches the air, and the whole canyon seems to shrink around it.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Young Fire Dragon represents the dragon at its most volatile and aggressive stage of development. Roughly a century old, it has only recently claimed territory and begun building its hoard. Lacking the refined cruelty of an ancient wyrm, the young dragon kills with straightforward ferocity and territorial rage. It has survived the vulnerable years when larger predators hunted it, and now it hungers to establish itself as an apex threat.

Young fire dragons are known for their impetuous nature. They attack without strategy—mostly. They communicate through roars, ground tremors, and the scent of sulfur. They remember who wronged them and actively pursue revenge against intruders. A young dragon that has been wounded or had its hoard disturbed will hunt down those responsible with single-minded fury.

These dragons typically inhabit volcanic highlands, volcanic canyons, and mountain regions with extensive cave systems. They are more likely to be sighted than older dragons, partly because they hunt more actively and range further from their lairs. Merchants, adventurers, and settlements in mountain valleys must contend with periodic sightings and attacks.

## Presentation

A young fire dragon is sleek and muscular, built for speed as much as raw power. Its scales form an overlapping pattern of crimson, copper, and burnished gold, with undertones of burned orange that deepen near the spine. The scales themselves are warm to the touch, radiating heat even at rest. Its eyes are molten amber, tracking motion with predatory focus.

The creature stands roughly 16 feet from nose to rump, with a wingspan extending to nearly 24 feet when fully spread. Its body is lean compared to older dragons, with prominent musculature visible beneath the armor of scales. The wings are proportionally large, built for the agility that young dragons use to their advantage. Its tail is thick and weapon-like, scarred from territorial disputes with other large creatures.

Heat shimmers constantly around the young dragon. Its breath steams visibly even in warm weather. Where it walks, the ground darkens from heat stress. Its presence is announced by temperature gradients—the air grows progressively hotter as one approaches.

## Key Behaviors

**Territorial Aggression:** The young dragon will attack anything it perceives as a threat to its territory or hoard. It does not negotiate or parley; it has not yet learned that words can be more useful than fire.

**Impulsive Hunting:** Unlike older dragons, a young fire dragon hunts actively for food and for the sport of the kill. It will pursue prey for considerable distances if they flee.

**Hoard-Obsession:** The dragon has recently begun accumulating treasure and guards its hoard jealously. The hoard is often smaller than that of a mature dragon but defended with equal ferocity.

**Curiosity and Pride:** Young dragons are curious about the world and proud of their capabilities. They may spare prey briefly to gloat, though this moment of vanity rarely lasts long.

**Response to Perceived Disrespect:** Any challenge or act of defiance triggers immediate, explosive retaliation. Diplomacy is nearly impossible once offense has been taken.

## Combat Strategy

The young dragon relies on speed and aggression rather than tactics. Its strategy in battle is straightforward: close to melee range, burn everything, and pursue fleeing enemies. It favors high-altitude combat when possible, using the advantage of flight to strafe enemies while remaining out of reach.

When cornered or facing a numerically superior foe, the young dragon will unleash a devastating fire breath and then attempt to create distance by launching into the air. It is not yet wise enough to play for position or feign retreat; when it retreats, it intends to return with greater force.

The dragon will attempt to isolate individual foes and destroy them one at a time rather than spread its attention across a large group. It has minimal respect for human tactics and armor, believing its own hide to be invulnerable—a belief reinforced by its recent victories against lesser predators.

## Attack Methods

### Bite

A young dragon's bite can sever limbs. The creature attacks with its full body weight behind the strike, often using a bite to grab and pin prey before clawing or burning them. Damage is catastrophic to any target unable to withstand the force.

### Claw Rake

The dragon rakes with both front claws in a blurring combination, capable of shredding armor and flesh alike. This attack is favored as a finishing move on pinned opponents or a follow-up to successful bite attacks.

### Tail Sweep

The dragon whips its tail in a wide arc, using it both to strike and to keep enemies at bay. This attack can knock smaller creatures down or off balance, creating opening for other attacks.

### Fire Breath

The dragon exhales a spreading gout of roiling flame that reaches 15 feet. The fire ignites combustibles instantly and severely burns all caught in its path. The young dragon can use this ability multiple times before fatiguing, though each use drains its reserves.

## Special Abilities

### Fire Breath

The young dragon's flame reaches 15 feet in a spreading gout. Creatures caught in it are severely burned. The dragon can use this ability three times before requiring rest, though it may push itself to use it more frequently at the cost of temporary exhaustion.

### Flight

With a wingspan of nearly 24 feet, the young dragon is a powerful flier capable of sustained aerial combat. It uses flight to maintain distance from grounded opponents and to pursue fleeing prey.

### Armored Scales

The dragon's scales turn most blows. Ordinary weapons struggle to penetrate deeply; magical weapons or sustained focused attacks are required to cause significant injury.

### Heat Aura

Ambient heat radiates from the dragon constantly. The temperature within 30 feet of the creature rises noticeably, causing discomfort and making the area difficult to traverse quickly. Extended exposure to this heat can cause exhaustion.
